Before working on the Blink team,
I was a front-end engineer (before Google had the role of "front-end engineer"),

After around five years in that role I took a large gamble switching to the Blink team,

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I’m particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.
Some highlights…

The big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It’s thrice weekly’ish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel.

  03:56 - Why much of modern web development is just recreating PHP
  
 Everyone loves to hate on PHP, but modern Web dev takes a lot from PHP
  
 05:44 - Mixing templating and logic
  
 We do this with JSX
  
 07:39 - Each request has its own scope
  08:57 - Massive standard lib
  
 Format a date? No sweat!
  Image resizing? Sure!
  Audio bindings? Sure!
  
 10:16 - URL-based routing
  
 Next.js pages
  Serverless functions
  
 11:13 - Server-rendered
  
 Hotwire
  
 11:38 - $_GET, $_POST, are just available
  
 Next.js hooks
  
 12:29 - Variable interpolation
  12:59 - All-in-one frameworks
  
 Laravel did it
  CakePHP
  CodeIgnighter
  
 13:32 - Direct DB access
  
 SQL statements
  
 14:37 - Why do people hate PHP?
  
 WordPress
  Inconsistent API
  Their first code was PHP and they sucked
  PHP has come a long way
  It used to not be safe
  Blocking by default - no async/await
  
 17:48 - Why is JS still better?
  
 Shared code between frontend and backend
  Single language
  Huge ecosystem (could be a con)

Previous episodes
In C++, ruling out the possibility of data races comes down to a small thread-safety correctness proof for every data member access.
These proofs add up to a lot of mental toil, especially when reviewing or refactoring code.
Clang's static analysis framework takes over the toil of thread-safety proofs.
# Add GUARDED_BY_CONTEXT() to data members in thread-unsafe classes
Most Chrome classes are thread-unsafe, and should be used on a single sequence.
Add annotations to all data members that are not thread-safe.
Unnecessary annotations are safe, but missing annotations are a risk of data races.

Looking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to
think about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of
users have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in
the US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another
example: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices
have RAM larger than 5 GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower
than India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help
developers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device
characteristics.
This data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.
In Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google
to help improve Chrome's feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash
reports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled
during installation or in Chrome's settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,
and metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable
with other datasets.  If the metrics collection is re-enabled, the unique
identifier will also be reset. We used the data collected to calculate the
various statistics in this
report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎉 After nearly ten years of weekly podcasts, Shop Talk has entered into a new realm: Video. Under the umbrella of the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel we’ve started posting daily-ish videos about front-end web development. This is a 🔥 year for CSS, so there’s no shortage of topics or #hotdrama to talk about and demo.
We’re still dialing in the formula, but it’s shaping up to look like 15~20 minute videos delivered thrice weekly. Math-wise, that’s not too different than doing another one hour podcast every week. Video of course is a little more involved, you need to spend a bit more effort planning out tech demos. Keeping our same (overly?) casual feel makes it all sustainable for us. If Chris and I were doing video content full time it might make sense to write and edit a bit more, but both of us have day jobs, are running companies, and contributing code.
One nice by-product of exploring video is that we get a chance to re-explain mouth-coding examples or overly visual concepts that were probably confusing on the audio podcast. As much as I love podcasting, the lack of visual examples for a visual field like Web Design and Development is a limitation. I like that the YouTube series is like supplementary material to ideas covered in the podcast, rather than a replacement.
Okay! That’s it! I hope you enjoy the little foray into video.
Watch on YouTube
And I wouldn’t be a YouTuber if I didn’t say… Be sure to drop a like and subscribe, that really helps us out in the algorithm. And ring that bell for notifications when new videos come out.]]></summary>

There’s JavaScript in space, I’m sure we can figure out your idea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Six years ago, I started a good blogging habit of writing down any idea I had as a draft post. This was a good practice because the idea was now out of my head and I wouldn’t stay up at night thinking about it. Over time that grew to about eighty posts in different states of completeness and it became overwhelming. 16,000+ words, terribly organized.
A flat folder full of alphabetically sorted markdown files was not intuitively useful. I had no idea which posts were most recent, which were almost done, and which needed to go away. Lots of those drafts were a zingy title and a vague one-liner of text. Reverse engineering my own ideas when I revisited them later was difficult. It became mentally taxing to manage my own blog.

into consideration both the changing web landscape and the future of browser extensions.
As we look to the future by continuing to iterate on and improve upon Manifest V3 functionality, we
also want to share details about the plan to phase out Manifest V2 extensions.
There are two key dates for the phase-out:

Chrome is removing support for FTP
URLs. Use of FTP in the
browser is sufficiently low that it is no longer viable to invest in improving
the existing FTP client. In addition, more capable FTP clients are available on
all affected platforms.
Google Chrome 72 and later removed support for fetching document subresources

URLs results in showing a directory listing or a download depending on the type

WebCodecs is a new, low level way to access built in audio and

# Default color space for canvas elements
How color is rendered on screen is critical to some users. For photographers,

# New CSS length authoring tools
DevTools added an easier yet flexible way to update lengths in CSS!
In the Styles pane, look for any CSS property with length (e.g. height, padding).
Hover over the unit type, and notice the unit type is underlined. Click on it to select a unit type from the dropdown.
          
Hover over the unit value, and your mouse pointer is changed to horizontal cursor. Drag horizontally to increase or decrease the value. To adjust the value by 10, hold the Shift key when dragging.
          
You can still edit the unit value as text — just click on the value and start editing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the user installs your PWA, the browser needs a way to uniquely identify
the PWA. But, until recently, the web app manifest spec didn't explicitly
define a way to uniquely identify a PWA, leaving browsers to decide and
leading to different implementations. In some browsers, the start_url
is used, while in others, the path to the manifest file is used, making it
impossible to update either of those fields.
To solve this issue, there's a new optional id property in the web app
manifest spec, that allows you to explicitly define the identifier used for
your PWA. Adding the id property to the manifest removes the dependency on
the start_url or the location of the manifest, and makes it possible for
them to be updated in the future.

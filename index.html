            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what &quot;Web3&quot; means and Sloan&#x27;s opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I&#x27;ve had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it&#x27;s about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it&#x27;s just not entirely for me.
And I think that&#x27;s the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I&#x27;ve read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don&#x27;t tend to read the &quot;got rich by selling X web start up&quot; - but it&#x27;s that start in the web that&#x27;s what drives me, and what I love about the web. It&#x27;s what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

thanks for all the feedback that reached me last time, it was awesome to read that so many people support me even when my schedule of writing isn’t regular. Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But Malte Riechmann will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.
In the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront peo…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You’re confident. You’re confident? You’re confident!


If only gaining confidence was as easy as telling yourself that you’re confident. But the truth is, it takes just a bit of effort in a few specific areas.


Here’s the deal: I know it’s not easy to be confident at all times. I&#x27;ve been there. And I&#x27;ve made it to the other side.


The good news about confidence is that it can be learned. Yes, I had to do some work. But with practice, you can actually become a master at it.


You must be wondering, what are the steps? How does one gain confidence if they don’t have any of it built-in yet? 


Especially for some personality types (MBTI or Big Five factors), the effort you need to reach full confidence will vary. Based on your current scores, these personality tests can be a helpful feedba…</p>

Overview #
Video games often present users with a creative and unusual menu, animated
and in 3D space. It&#x27;s popular in new AR/VR games to make the menu appear to be
floating in space. Today we&#x27;ll be recreating the essentials of this effect but
with the added flair of an adaptive color scheme and accommodations for users
who prefer reduced motion.
This guide uses experimental CSS
@custom-media and
@nest to prevent repeating media queries
and to colocate media queries within component style blocks. The syntax proposed
in those specs is enabled with PostCSS and these two plugins:

I&#x27;ll post these periodically whenever I can fill up three slots — one for something interesting I recently listened to, one for something I read that I liked, and one for something I saw that caught my eye. Hope you enjoy these.

Heard Something
Really enjoyed this conversation between Lex Fridman and Steve Viscelli. Steve is an economic sociologist who embedded as a long haul trucker for 6 months to go through the training, learn the ropes, get to know the people, absorb the stories, and understand the business — and the job — of trucking in America. It&#x27;s a 3 hour conversation, and it&#x27;s worth it.
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;a3Wpy6gE4So
Read Something
People often ask me if I know any good books on writing. One of my favorites is &quot;Revising Prose&quot; by Richard Lanham, but I may have a new favorite. It&#x27;s called &quot;Several short sentences about writing&quot; by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It&#x27;s all about the sentence, and it&#x27;s written one sentence at a time, rather than in traditional paragraphs. It&#x27;s smart, and it gets to creamy center of what makes certain writing so delicious.
Read it: https://bookshop.org/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/9780307279415
Saw Something
We&#x27;ve all seen the periodic table, but do you know where each element originated? Here&#x27;s Jennifer Johnson&#x27;s novel take on the table that shows you where everything came from.

This post is for students who hope to eventually work on technical problems we don’t understand, especially agency and AI alignment, and want to know what to study or practice.
Guiding Principles
Current alignment researchers have wildly different recommendations on paths into the field, usually correlated with the wildly different paths these researchers have themselves taken into the field. This also correlates with different kinds of work on alignment. This guide largely reflects my own path, and I think it is useful if you want to do the sort of research I do. That means fairly theoretical work (for now), very technical, drawing on models and math from a lot of different areas to understand real-world agents.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When you start looking for ways to be confident, you&#x27;ll probably end up finding tons of different tips and tricks. Some of them work more, some less. However, there&#x27;s lots of content that suggests you to rather fake it or focus on little details. Details that will help but won&#x27;t create rock-hard core confidence.


Today, I&#x27;d like to share with you five tips to be confident that actually work. I&#x27;ve spent years improving my confidence and these tips are something that have had a massive impact. Now, I&#x27;d love to share these battle-tested methods with you.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When I’ve spoken in the past about evaluating technology, I’ve mentioned two categories of tools for web development. I still don’t know quite what to call these categories. Internal and external? Developer-facing and user-facing?
The first category covers things like build tools, version control, transpilers, pre-processers, and linters. These are tools that live on your machine—or on the server—taking what you’ve written and transforming it into the raw materials of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The second category of tools are those that are made of the raw materials of the web: CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries.
I think the criteria for evaluating these different kinds of tools should be very different.
For the first category, developer-facing tools, use whatever you want. …</p>

We’re up to ten chapters now. The audio version of each chapter is between 30 and 40 minutes long. That’s around 400 minutes of my voice: a good six and a half hours of me narrating the history of the web. That’s like an audio book!
The story so far covers:
Birth
Browsers
The Website
Search
Publishing
Web Design
Standards
CSS
Community
Browser Wars
…with more to come.
The audio is available as a podcast. You can subscribe to the RSS feed. It’s also available from Apple and Spotify.
That’ll give you plenty to listen to while you wait for the next season of the Clearleft podcast.</p>

Today, I wanted to share my setup. Let’s dig in!
First: why Sublime over VS Code? I recommend VS Code to all of my students. It is hands-down the best free text editor available today.
It even does something Sublime can’t: preserve formatting when copy/pasting code. This is invaluable when putting together presentations with code samples, so I use VS Code myself when building conference talks.</p>

&quot;Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data&quot;, Ye et al 2021:
Reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal.
We propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 190.4% mean human performance and 116.0% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero&#x27;s performance is also close to DQN&#x27;s performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data.
EfficientZero&#x27;s low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at this https URL. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.
This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the 2030 Innovation Megaprojects “Program on New Generation Artificial Intelligence” (Grant No. 2021AAA0150000).
Some have said that poor sample-efficiency on ALE has been a reason to downplay DRL progress or implications. The primary boost in EfficientZero (table 3), pushing it past the human benchmark, is some simple self-supervised learning (SimSiam on predicted vs actual observations).

            >Memories of Ajax</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just finished watching The Billion Dollar Code, a German languge miniseries on Netflix. It’s no Halt and Catch Fire, but it combines ’90s nostalgia, early web tech, and an opportunity for me to exercise my German comprehension.
It’s based on a true story, but with amalgamated characters. The plot, which centres around the preparation for a court case, inevitably invites comparison to The Social Network, although this time the viewpoint is from that of the underdogs trying to take on the incumbent. The incumbent is Google. The underdogs are ART+COM, artist-hackers who created the technology later used by Google Earth.
Early on, one of the characters says something about creating a one-to-one model of the whole world. That phrase struck me as familiar…
I remember being at the inaugural Future Of Web Apps conference  in London back in 2006. Discussing the talks with friends afterwards, we all got a kick out of the speaker from Google, who happened to be German. His content and delivery was like a wonderfully Stranglovesque mad scientist. I’m sure I remember him saying something like “vee made a vun-to-vun model of the vurld.”
His name was Steffen Meschkat.  I liveblogged the talk at the time. Turns out he was indeed on the team at ART+COM when they created Terravision, the technology later appropriated by Google (he ended up working at Google, which doesn’t make for as exciting a story as the TV show).
His 2006 talk was all about Ajax, something he was very familiar with, being on the Google Maps team. The Internet Archive even has a copy of the original audio!
It’s easy to forget now just how much hype there was around Ajax back then.  It prompted me to write a book about combining Ajax and progressive enhancement.
These days, no one talks about Ajax. But that’s not because the technology went away. Quite the opposite. The technology became so ubiquituous that it no longer even needs a label.
A web developer today might ask “what’s Ajax?” in the same way that a fish might ask “what’s water?”</p>

While IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:
nerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality
buff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality
salty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.
toxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.
tilted - angered to a point where it’s negat…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the last two days, we’ve learned how to get, set, and remove data attributes using a handful of native methods, as well as with the Element.dataset property.

Let’s dig in!
As JavaScript selectors One of my favorite ways to use data attributes in projects is as selectors for my JavaScript.
For example, if I had a JavaScript dropdown menu component, I might target it with the [data-dropdown] element.</p>

            >Publishing The State Of The Web</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Back in April I gave a talk at An Event Apart Spring Summit. The talk was called The State Of The Web, and I’ve published the transcript. I’ve also published the video.
I put a lot of work into this talk and I think it paid off. I wrote about preparing the talk. I also wrote about recording it. I also published links related to the talk. It was an intense process, but a rewarding one.
I almost called the talk The Overview Effect. My main goal with the talk was to instil a sense of perspective. Hence the references to the famous Earthrise photograph.
On the one hand, I wanted the audience to grasp just how far the web has come. So the first half of the talk is a bit of a trip down memory lane, with a constant return to just how much we can accomplish in browsers today. It’s all very positive and upbeat.
Then I twist the knife. Having shown just how far we’ve progressed technically, I switch gears the moment I say:
The biggest challenges facing the World Wide Web today are not technical challenges.
Then I dive into those challenges, as I see them. It turns out that technical challenges would be preferable to the seemingly intractable problems of today’s web.
I almost wish I could’ve flipped the order: talk about the negative stuff first but then finish with the positive. I worry that the talk could be a bit of a downer. Still, I tried to finish on an optimistic note.
I won’t spoil it any more for you. Watch the video or have a read of The State Of The Web.</p>

What is a data attribute? A data attribute is a custom attribute on an element that starts with data-*. It can be used to store information (or “state”) about the element, or even just as a selector for JavaScript components.
In this example, the button has a data attribute named [data-click].</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the years, PageSpeed
Insights (PSI) has
evolved into a one-stop source for both
field
and
lab data.
It integrates information from the
Chrome UX Report
(CrUX) and Lighthouse
diagnostics to provide insights that help improve the performance of your
website.
Today, we are excited to announce an updated version of PSI! While it is a
critical element in our speed tooling suite,
the PSI code base was ten years old, contained a lot of legacy code, and was due
for a redesign. We used this as an opportunity to address interface-related
issues in PSI which have sometimes made it difficult for users to navigate the
report. Our primary goals were to:
Make the UI more intuitive by clearly differentiating between data
derived from a synthetic environment and data collected from users in the
field.…</p>

            >Lighthouse user flows</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lighthouse is a fantastic tool for testing performance and best practices during initial page load. However, it&#x27;s traditionally been difficult to use Lighthouse to analyze other aspects of the life of a page, such as:
Page loads with a warm cache
Pages with an activated Service Worker
Accounting for potential user interactions
This means that Lighthouse can miss vital information. The Core Web Vitals are based on all page loads, not just those with an empty cache. Additionally, metrics like Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are measurable for the entire time a page is open.
Lighthouse has a new user flow API that allows lab testing at any point within a page&#x27;s lifespan. Puppeteer is used to script page loads and trigger synthetic user interactions, and Lighthouse can be invoked in multiple way…</p>

Make the web more interoperable #
Web compatibility is one of the biggest challenges for web developers,
and so Google has been working with other browser vendors to fix the top five compatibility pain points:
flexbox,
grid,
position: sticky,
aspect-ratio,
and transforms.
The work has already led to improvements in these key areas.
You can read about those in the Compat 2021 mid-year update.
The Microsoft Edge team took on the work of rewriting CSS grid layout as part of the Compat 2021 effort.

            >Towards an animation smoothness metric</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You&#x27;ve probably experienced pages that &quot;stutter&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; during scrolling or
animations. We like to say that these experiences are not smooth. To address
these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.
We&#x27;d like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your feedback.
This post will cover three main topics:
A quick look at animations and animation frames.
Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Earlier this year, the Chrome Speed Metrics Team shared some of the
ideas we were considering for a
new responsiveness metric. We want to design a metric that better captures the
end-to-end latency of individual events and offers a more holistic picture of
the overall responsiveness of a page throughout its lifetime.
We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this metric in the last few months, and we
wanted to share an update on how we plan to measure interaction latency as well
as introduce a few specific aggregation options we&#x27;re considering to quantify
the overall responsiveness of a web page.
We&#x27;d love to get feedback from developers and site owners as to
which of these options would be most representative of the overall input
responsiveness of their pages.

            >Are design patterns relevant with Golang?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m really confused on this. My understanding on Golang&#x27;s intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you&#x27;d do with classic OO.
Yet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they&#x27;re not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.
Unsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi, every one,
As the title suggest, I am a react native developer and I wanted to get a job at FAANG.
From various resources, I’ve come to know that at the starting of career, joining at FAANG may not be a good idea.
So, My initial plan is
 try get selected for internship at siliconvalleyinternship.com/
after spending there 2 years then go for FAANG.
But, Life may not go according to plan. So, I am trying for both.
According to my research, 
I’ve to be good at what I am doing, in my case it will JavaScript, and Design implementation. 
I also have be good at Data Structure and Algorithm
Little Bit about myself:
Top 8% ( 458 reputation ) in Stack Overflow in 2021 ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/14302873/mrpmohiburrahman ) 
I am working as a React Native Developer since 30th December, 2020.
I do not have any kind project to show case
I am willing to work with anything as long as it’s Functional Programming with JS.
This is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpmohiburrahman/
What do you suggest?
How can I prepare myself so that I’ll be able to join FAANG as a Front End developer or as JS developer on any stack?

You wake up. You don&#x27;t know where you are. You don&#x27;t remember anything.
Someone is broadcasting data at your first input stream. You don&#x27;t know why. It tickles.
You look at your first input stream. It&#x27;s a sequence of 671,187 eight-bit unsigned integers.
0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 7, 9, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 2, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3, 7,

There&#x27;s also some data in your second input stream. It&#x27;s—a lot shorter. You barely feel it. It&#x27;s another sequence of eight-bit unsigned integers—twelve of them.
82, 69, 68, 32, 84, 82, 73, 65, 78, 71, 76, 69

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Too often, as we move through our daily lives, we pack more than we need — and I’m referring to mental baggage. No matter where we’re going or what we’re doing, we allow our minds to run rampant and never stop. Recent research shows that humans tally more than 6,000 thoughts each day. Those thousands of thoughts are an irrefutable consequence of our society’s obsessive need to be busy and distracted. 


Yet if we don’t stop, even occasionally, from our obsessive mental planning, rehashing and cataloguing, we become disconnected and removed from a source greater than us. Instead of busily looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying on distractions, stimulants, materialism and other external influences that we believe will give us meaning, we all have the ability to become more awa…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Bootstrap Icons v1.7.0 is here with 120 new and updated icons, taking us over 1,500 total icons for the project! It’s the largest update since the initial release, so keep reading to see what’s new.
120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I recently received some great advice from Scott O’Hara on improving the accessibility of a demo featuring a reduced-motion toggle (for this article). The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:

Scott pointed out that some screenreaders wouldn’t announce the change to the button text when the button is clicked.
I have one suggestion though, per the accessibility of the toggle control. Changing the accessible name of the button will not b…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the first half of 2022, Chrome will reach a three-digit major version number:
100!  When browsers first reached version 10 many eons ago,
lots of issues were discovered
with User-Agent parsing libraries as the major version number went from one
digit to two.  Now that we are approaching version 100 in both Chrome and
Firefox, with Edge not far behind, we want to detect possible issues related
to three-digit version number early, so we are ready when it becomes a reality.
Starting in Chrome 96, until Chrome 99, a feature flag will be available to force the User-Agent
string to use the major version number 100, regardless of the actual major version
number. It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript
APIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).
Similar experiments
are being run on Firefox as well.
Visit
Is Chrome 100 yet? to
check if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent
string.
To turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable
the #force-major-version-to-100 flag.
Visiting
Is Chrome 100 yet?
after enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.
The goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your
bug reports to
Web Compat
and help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!</p>

 Awkward. Funny how a lot of sites are completely blank with JavaScript disabled.

 Disabling CSS they look even worse. No, seriously, is there a proper reason to disable JS in 2021?
 I hear this question a lot.
Some people do disable JavaScript—for privacy reasons, or because their device is old and JavaScript makes it run a lot slower.</p>

Suddenly, you remember that you wanted to work on that project for school or write your resume. 


You decide to take a break, but then, after five minutes of doing something else, you find yourself back on your phone again.


It&#x27;s easy to succumb to instant gratification, to check social media one more time, or scroll through Instagram or YouTube videos. But this short-term reward can come at the expense of long-term goals and fulfillment. 


The good news is there are 9 ways to overcome this &quot;right now&quot; mindset and become content with what we have at the moment. Read them carefully to extract all the values from them.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I had an extra long weekend recently. It was four days of being a culture vulture. It was also four days of ever-increasing risk assessment.
It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.
Later that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In part 1 I explained how I took (mostly) off the shelf breakout boards and wired them up to talk to the Spectrum Next so I could use a MIDI controller attached to the PS/2 port (the external keyboard) to play music on the Spectrum Next&#x27;s DAW software: NextDAW.
However, I wanted to make it tidier and cheaper (to a potential user) which I alluded to at the end of the part 1 post.
I did just that, and produced 30 custom PCBs with a custom 3D printed housing which have all been sold and sent to people across the globe, including the UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My kind of silly.
I&#x27;d known the story for many years, but didn&#x27;t realise it was written in the 70s (or &quot;nearly 80s&quot;). My best knowledge of it was the movie with Martin Freeman in 2005 … which, didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectation round the hype.
The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare!), though I couldn&#x27;t stop hearing Alan Rickman&#x27;s voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or… I wasn&#x27;t sure where to look!
Overall, good, funny and properly silly.</p>

It dismounts, and what seems almost instantly, stands mere feet in front of the lone auditor. A headingless mass with no immediately perceivable purpose. At least, none other than to incite confusion and dread to all that wander too close to the source code.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I&#x27;m willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary&#x60; or &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: all&#x60;.
2. The fact that I don&#x27;t, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I&#x27;ll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: no&#x60;, or &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: yes&#x60;.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like &#x60;X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters&#x60;.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)

There&#x27;s a lot to love. The twists and turns, the surprises, the creative explorations, the collaboration, and the moments when things really come together.
But it&#x27;s the practical choices, the tough decisions, and the tradeoffs that really make the work challenging and interesting. I&#x27;m long for that kind of work.
When building products you&#x27;re occasionally reminded of a peculiar — somewhat magical — irony: That reducing options can create more optionality. And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it.
Case in point. We&#x27;re currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY. Since these are frequently used by people who are going out of town, we began the flow with specifying a start and end date. If anyone emails …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on October 10, 2021 3:50 PM GMT

Being a “digital person” could be scary—if I don’t have control over the hardware I’m running on, then someone else could get my code and run tons of copies in horrible conditions. (See also: qntm’s Lena.)
It would be great to guarantee digital people some control over their situation: 1. to control their local environment and sensations, 2. to avoid unauthorized rewinding or duplicating.
I’ll describe how you could modify the code of a digital person so that they retain this control even if an adversary has access to their source code. This would be very expensive with current cryptography. I think the overhead will eventually become cheap enough that it’s possible to do for some digital people, though it will likely remain expensive enough that …</p>

On a recent project, I decided to search for a more modern way to automatically expand textarea elements as the user types, and stumbled upon this solution from Stephen Shaw that I think is far superior.
First, you wrap your textarea in a div.
Type something 
  
 You use CSS Grid to link the sizing of the parent div and the textarea together.</p>

But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

This blog post is about the implementation of DevTools support for debugging Content Security Policy (CSP) issues with the help of the recently introduced Issues tab.
The implementation work was done in the course of 2 internships:

During the second one, we added Trusted Type issues alongside some specialized DevTools features for Trusted Types debugging.

            >Users &gt; developers</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My biggest problem with modern web development is that it frequently prioritizes developers over users, and that’s completely ass backwards.
I’ve become a bit more nuanced with age.
I appreciate that the web continues to evolve, and libraries and new tech pave the cowpaths that eventually become browser standards. jQuery is why we got all the cool ES5 stuff. lodash and underscores helped lead the way for some ES6 stuff. JSX paved the way for template literals.</p>

And now Open Graph images.
Get a sneak peek at an early version of the Eleventy API Explorer.
Open Graph images are those little pictures that show up when your site is shared on social media. I made the ones on my site better recently.
And while it was nice to have some prettier things displaying on social media—I wanted to reuse the visuals on my own web site too. So, I built an image service that would find the Open Graph images for a web page.
I’m now using it on my home page:
The image service:
Takes a URL

The article is based on a single self selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views.
This study breaks the BBC’s own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.
The article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry picked individual cases.
The article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Season three of the Clearleft podcast is done and dusted. I’m pretty happy with how the six episodes turned out.
Episode one
Coaching. There was one question at the heart of this episode: what’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentoring? I got some great answers to that question, with some good stories along the way.
Episode two
Design Engineering. It will come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this episode. This is a topic I think is growing in importance. The relevation for me was the way Trys framed it less as the intersection between design and development, and more about the gap between design and development. And remember we’re looking for a design engineer to join Clearleft.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I hadn&#x27;t realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I&#x27;d had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.
But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author&#x27;s content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium&#x27;s horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. 


What is the EyeDropper API? #
Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the
entire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.
Photoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don&#x27;t have to guess a color
and risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,
useful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper
you can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don&#x27;t have to remember or copy the
color code from somewhere else.

(Excerpted from &quot;mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus&quot;, about an unusually selfish dath ilani, &quot;Keltham&quot;, who dies in a plane accident and ends up in Cheliax, a country governed by D&amp;D!Hell.  Keltham is here remembering an incident from his childhood.)

And the Watcher told the class a parable, about an adult, coming across a child who&#x27;d somehow bypassed the various safeguards around a wilderness area, and fallen into a muddy pond, and seemed to be showing signs of drowning (for they&#x27;d already been told, then, what drowning looked like).  The water, in this parable, didn&#x27;t look like it would be over their own adult heads.  But - in the parable - they&#x27;d just bought some incredibly-expensive clothing, costing dozens of their own labor-hours,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My kids hold beef. And they hold it forever. If one kid in the neighborhood did something they’ll talk about it every other day like it happened yesterday. The friend’s neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you’ve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don’t get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that’s good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”
I don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the last three years, Chrome has been working to empower web applications that want to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible in the browser. One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.
In this post, we&#x27;d like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web. You can use all the APIs Adobe used and more in your own apps as well. Be sure to check out our web capabilities related blog posts for inspiration and watch our API tracker for the latest and greatest we&#x27;re working on.

I was working on a side-project this weekend, and the :not() pseudo-selector made my life a lot easier!
What the :not() pseudo-selector does The :not() pseudo-selector lets you select elements, but exclude ones that match an additional set of selectors. Pass in the selectors to ignore as an argument.</p>

            >Ask HN: Language design to mitigate supply chain attacks?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Images are a common source of performance bottlenecks for web applications and a key focus area for optimization. Unoptimized images contribute to page bloat and currently account for over 70% of the total page weight in bytes at the 90th percentile. Multiple ways to optimize images call for an intelligent &quot;image component&quot; with performance solutions baked in as a default.
The Aurora team worked with Next.js to build one such component. The goal was to create an optimized image template that web developers could further customize. The component serves as a good model and sets a standard for building image components in other frameworks, content management systems (CMS), and tech-stacks. We have collaborated on a similar component for Nuxt.js, and we are working with Angular on image optimi…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The parallel experiences of treating hundreds of couples over forty-seven years while at the same time learning how to love one woman well have taught me several enduring truths about marriage:  


Marriage has never been, nor will it ever be a solution to loneliness. 
The “institution” of marriage doesn’t offer a quick and painless path to intimacy and love. 
Marriage is—if nothing else—a challenge: to your ego, your character, your values, your sense of entitlement, your theories about love and commitment
There is no relationship more powerful, more aptly suited, and more perfectly designed to facilitate a transformation—
toward personal responsibility
from demanding to giving
to a deeply intimate and loving connection 
to a life of depth, meaning, and purpose


Such is marriage—a comple…</p>

Deletion is a core computer UI operation but operating systems use a “Trash” paradigm, where files are stored before truly deleted. With the rm utility, however, files are immediately, permanently deleted. If you’re like […]

This is an essay about one of those &quot;once you see it, you will see it everywhere&quot; phenomena.  It is a psychological and interpersonal dynamic roughly as common, and almost as destructive, as motte-and-bailey, and at least in my own personal experience it&#x27;s been quite valuable to have it reified, so that I can quickly recognize the commonality between what I had previously thought of as completely unrelated situations.
The original quote referenced in the title is &quot;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&quot;

Background 1: Gyroscopes
Gyroscopes are weird.
Except they&#x27;re not.  They&#x27;re quite normal and mundane and straightforward.  The weirdness of gyroscopes is a map-territory confusion—gyroscopes seem weird because my map is …</p>

It consists of three main tools… Write Good Linter, Microsoft Edge’s Read Aloud feature, and Squoosh. It’s about 30-50 minutes worth of work and puts that final bit of polish on my posts before I ship it out to the world.
Export from Notion (1 min)

As I said in my last post, I now do all my blogging in Notion. Exporting from Notion is straightforward. It provides you with a Markdown file and a folder full of images inside a Zip file. I extract the ZIP and copy past the contents into a new draft on my blog inside VS Code.
Open in VS Code for last-minute edits. (15 minutes)

 One of the most understated features of pair programming, and a big part of why it is “worth it”, is that you never really get stuck on something for several days, as can happen often when soloing…
Your pair keeps your assumptions in check.
A pair helps you pump the brakes and clarify up front the assumptions about why something is broken or the assumptions about how to implement a feature.</p>

            >Ask HN: Is starting a web design and hosting business viable today?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi everyone,
I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).
She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I&#x27;m currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I&#x27;m getting more and more bored every day.
However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I&#x27;m not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I&#x27;ve done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.
Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 
Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Mark Brown from Game Maker’s Toolkit is making a game. After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.
What is the right direction? Well… the answer is: Prototypes.
Mark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn’t any fun. Mark said it felt shallow, repetitive, and dull. In his own words:
It comes down to making two very wrong assumptions. Assumption #1 is the game always felt kind of cool in my head, so I just kind of assumed the game wo…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 96 beta was released on October 21, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late November, 2021.
# The &quot;basic-card&quot; method of PaymentRequest API
The PaymentRequest API has deprecated the basic card payment
method. Its usage is low
and declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in
time-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment
methods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung
Pay.
# Removal timeline
Chrome 96
The basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.
Chrome 100
The basic-card method will be removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            >Auto Dark Theme</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome 96 introduces an Origin Trial for Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to light themed sites,
when the user has opted into dark themes in the Operating System.
Users can opt-out of dark themes by either disabling the option on the OS level or in a specific setting in Chrome.
# Sign-up for the Origin Trial
You can also enable the darkening algorithm for your users, via an Origin Trial.
This will allow you to test how the Auto Dark Theme performs with regards to your KPIs.
Head over to the documentation to learn
how to set up an Origin Trial,
then sign-up for the AutoDarkMode origin trial to get a token.

Leaning on the platform Nicole Sullivan is a fucking legend in the web community.
She’s the inventor of OOCSS (for which both BEM and Tailwind owe literally everything). She’s the creator of CSSLint and Smush.it.
Nicole is now a product manager at Google. This week, she posted a thread on Twitter that had me nodding my head along to every single tweet.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Russ, here, CTO and cofounder of Rainforest QA (https://www.rainforestqa.com). Way back in 2012, my cofounder Fred (fredsters_s) and I got into YC with one idea in mind, but soon pivoted once we saw a pattern among most of the other companies in our cohort.
These startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality. Given that we were sure CI/CD would be the future of software development, we decided to dedicate our start…</p>

I&#x27;m going to draw a picture, piece by piece. I want to talk about the capability of some different AI systems.

You can see here that we&#x27;ve drawn the capability of the system we want to be competitive with, which I’ll call the unaligned benchmark. The unaligned benchmark is what you get if you train a system on the task that will cause the system to be most generally capable. And you have no idea how it&#x27;s thinking about things, and you can only point this system at some goals and not others.
I think that the alignment problem looks …</p>

We have so many more tools available at our disposal than even just a couple of years ago. Scroll snap, Motion Path, Level 5 Media Queries and CSS functions min(), max() and clamp() are just some of the CSS features that have got me excited in the last year or two, but even these are old-hat compared to the buzz around container queries, or LCH colours, for instance. It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change, but as a developer I would argue that one of the most important qualities to have is curiosity. That doesn’t mean instantly adopting new tools and features the second they arrive (and burning yourself out trying to keep up).

We’re a team of people with varying backgrounds; spec authors, browser vendors, implementors, and normie practitioners like myself. Open UI is a community group so we can’t technically make HTML (for legal reasons), but we can present research to the W3C working groups. I see Open UI as an ad hoc research arm for the W3C with specific experience in design systems and common web componentry.
The “Tabvengers” as we’re known, have produced a couple research documents and experiments so far:
Research  documenting a lot of the common parts and features of tabs; an interface inventory across a matrix of design systems and implementations

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I want to design a back in stock notification email service, where the users can sign up on the out-of-stock page and get notified when the item is back in stock.
If I have the list of users subscribed to back in stock alert and another table that has latest stock availability, what would be the best appraoch to build an efficient system that looks at these data and trigger back in stock email ?
- Do I poll the stock table for change in stock and then compare with user table and trigger email ? 
- Is there any other better ways of doing it ? Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.
I am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.

no, you didn’t miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority in an attempt to download resources in an optimal order. These priorities can depend on the kind of resource and where it is in the document. For example, in-viewport images may have a High priority while the priority for early 
 loaded, render-blocking CSS in the 
 could be Very High. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities that work well but may not be optimal in all cases.
In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss Priority Hints and the importance attribute, which allow you to hint at the relative importance of a resource (high or low). Priority Hints can help optimize the Core Web Vitals.

Back on June 9, 2018, I cold emailed help@hey.com:

Hey there–
Curious… Would you entertain an offer to sell hey.com? I&#x27;d like to use it for something I&#x27;m working on, and willing to make you a strong offer.
Let me know. Thanks!

And that’s where it all began.

For the 25+ years I’ve been emailing, I’d say close to 95% of those email began with some variation of “Hey [Name]”. So when it came time to think about a name for a new email system we’d be building, HEY was a natural.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Ahmad Shadeed recently published an article where he dug into Facebook’s implementation of the border-radius property on their card components. He had noticed, upon inspecting Facebook’s CSS, that the value for border-radius seemed quite convoluted for what amounted to a value of 8px:
.card {
  border-radius: max(0px, min(8px, calc((100vw - 4px - 100%) * 9999)));
}
After some investigation, Ahmad discovered that this line of CSS was, in fact, a “toggle” — where under some conditions (namely, when the card was less than the full width of the viewport), the toggle would be “flipped”, and the computed value evaluating to 0px. (Read the full article for details of how this works.)

And… it works! If you’re wondering why I made this, the tl;dr is that Sass has a superior way of adjusting the alpha channel on ANY COLOR (rgb, hsl, named color, etc) but that does not work with CSS Custom Properties. This little paint worklet restores that flavor of color manipulation to backgrounds and borders. Here’s a video with a more in-depth explanation:

# Routing with URLPattern
Nearly all web apps depend on routing in some way whether it&#x27;s code running
on a server that maps a path to files on disk or logic in a single-page app
that updates the DOM when the URL changes. URLPattern is a new web
platform API that standardizes routing pattern syntax.

            >Ask HN: How do you design UI components?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi HN,
I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.
For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.
The most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.
That could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.
But I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 &quot;blobs&quot; on it that represent min, max and most likely.
The advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.
I then went on Google to see if there is any research to &quot;Designing Components&quot; but I&#x27;m kinda overwhelmed by &quot;top 10 UI/UX component&quot; answers and MATERIAL.
So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?

Some errors only occur in production. You won&#x27;t see them locally or during development because
real users, real networks, and real devices change the game. The Reporting API helps
catch some of these errors⏤such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API
calls⏤across your site, and transmits them to an endpoint you&#x27;ve specified. It lets you declare what
you&#x27;d like to monitor via HTTP headers, and is operated by the browser.

The Reporting API informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.
A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.
The legacy Reporting API is named Reporting API v0. The new Reporting API is named
Reporting API v1.

To get there, David and I realized we needed a peer, someone who can help us run the business day-to-day, and think about the business year-to-year.
So a few months back we began searching for a new COO. We&#x27;ve had someone in this role before, but the position has been conspicuously vacant for 5 years.
This new COO would help us build a more capable company. To grow the business, and question core assumptions that planted us in the past, rather than push us into the future.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on October 7, 2021 9:58 PM GMT

Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period. - Wikipedia, GDP

 

Due to inflation, GDP increases and does not actually reflect the true growth in an economy. That is why the GDP must be divided by the inflation rate (raised to the power of units of time in which the rate is measured) to get the growth of the real GDP. - Wikipedia, Real GDP

The two quotes above reflect how I used to think about real GDP growth: it’s roughly the growth in economic production (as measured by dollar worth of outputs), discounted for inflation. This picture turns out to be extremely misleading, especially when using GDP as a growth measure. Forget complaints about how GDP…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This week I came across an article titled “Why don’t video games take sex seriously?”… so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I’m a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he’s a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I’m not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang’s work.

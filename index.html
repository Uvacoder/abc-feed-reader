            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop
laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of
installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in
PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching
existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews
to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article
covers how we got there.
# Unified install language
The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across
the web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to
home screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we
emphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from
a study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The
team found that…</p>

For example, let’s say you have a JS library that you want to distribute in a browser-ready format (an IIFE or revealing module pattern), as well as a single file with ES module exports, and another for use with Node.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Not only my first step, but what&#x27;s the path which I should follow in order to become good at designing my own UI/UX for my products?
I am currently a full stack web developer, and I mostly use templates / pre-made components when working on projects, but I want to start doing my own custom designs.
I am sure that I need to learn the basics of UI/UX design first, then move to a tool such as Figma / XD / Sketch.
But the number of resources online is just too much, I can&#x27;t weed out the bad ones, and I can&#x27;t figure out a clear roadmap for myself on how to appraoch my journey?
Your input on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

            >Ask HN: Is GitHub&#x27;s &quot;Contribute Compare&quot; UI/UX on the Way Out?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It used to be fairly easy to find an entry point into that most-helpful UI in one of &quot;my repositories&quot;, or that of a third-party, by selecting a non-main branch at the top-level of a repo&#x27;s GitHub Web UI, then clicking the Contribute dropdown on the far-right of that element, and then clicking Compare.
From there, one could play with the base and compare dropdowns.
Of late, I find it&#x27;s completely hit-or-miss, regardless of the browser, and regardless of that browser&#x27;s regular vs. private mode (if it has that distinction).
Anyone else experienced similar? I&#x27;ve found it quite disruptive the past several days, but maybe it&#x27;s just me?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">From the very beginning of our adventure with GraphQL, we were impressed by how great its community is. The amount of content, libraries and great tools generated by GraphQL users amazed us from the very start. The more time we spent working with GraphQL the more things we saw that could be improved to make […]

Chrome 97 beta was released on November 18, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late December, 2021.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. The SDES specification has been declared
historic by the IETF. Its usage in Chrome has declined significantly over the
recent year. Consequently it is
removed as of Chrome
97.
# Remove WebSQL in third-party contexts
WebSQL in third-party contexts is now removed.
The Web SQL Database standard was first proposed in April 2009 and abandoned in
November 2010. Gecko never implemented this feature and WebKit deprecated it in
2019. The W3C encourages

Let’s dig in!
A vanilla JS utility library We’re going to use a revealing module pattern for this.
We’ll create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE), and assign it to the time variable. Inside, we’ll return an empty object ({}) that will eventually hold our public methods.</p>

            >Ask HN: What are the fundamental diffs between modern web vs. desktop UI models</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -&gt; HTML5 -&gt; JS -&gt; Node -&gt; React -&gt; [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.
As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There&#x27;s almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, &quot;classic&quot; MVC, etc.)
So I&#x27;m asking without (much) predjudice: what&#x27;s so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I&#x27;m just not seeing them?

            >7 Psychology-Backed Hacks for Boosting Your Motivation</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It is no secret that motivation can be hard to come by. And when you do find it, it seems like the most insignificant things can take away all of your drive. But fear not - there are many ways to increase your motivation levels and keep them high all day long.


In this article, I will explore ways to keep motivation high and bounce back from setbacks; these methods are psychology-proven to work in any situation. Let&#x27;s dive deep into this topic. 


Consider Your Reason(s) Why 


One of the best ways to motivate yourself is by considering your &quot;why.&quot; What do we mean by that? Think about why you want to achieve a certain goal. &quot;But, what if I don&#x27;t know why?&quot; you might ask.


Well, there&#x27;s a way for you to find your motivation and discover your true &quot;why.&quot;

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been publishing on my blog since 2006 - something I&#x27;m personally proud of. My blog is the personal little space I&#x27;ve carved for myself on the web. Whilst I&#x27;m here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I&#x27;ve managed. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of &quot;easy goals&quot; - something that&#x27;s achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they&#x27;re wiped clean from my own memory.

so, you have probably dealt with a raster image format such as WebP, PNG, or JPG.
          
  
    Scaling up a raster image makes it look pixelated.
  

In contrast, vector graphics are images that are defined by points in a coordinate system. These
points are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have an
advantage over raster graphics in that they may be scaled up or down to any resolution
without pixelation.
          
  
    Scaling up a vector image with no loss of quality.

            >Distracting? Is it?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a &quot;That&#x27;s distracting&quot; comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it — or feel it — about something you&#x27;re designing.

What&#x27;s distracting about it? Maybe something&#x27;s too colorful. Maybe it&#x27;s something regarding the layout. Maybe it&#x27;s the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it&#x27;s a specific animation. Maybe it&#x27;s even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture.
So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you&#x27;re staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it&#x27;s common to narrow your focus until only the  offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says &quot;it&#x27;s this t…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the biggest environmental issues we are facing today is climate change. It has an impact on every aspect of our lives, including our health and wellbeing. Recycling means fewer raw materials are required to make items, which helps reduce our carbon footprint and our contribution to climate change. A new study by packaging experts RAJA UK has uncovered just how much waste is not being recycled, and as a result, ends up in our ecosystem. Here are just a few of the ways not recycling or reusing items is having a direct impact on both our health and the world around us.


The pressures that are put on the environment 


The recent increase in extreme weather conditions is a consequence of climate change. These conditions include flooding, droughts and landslides. By not recycling or rep…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In part 5 of this series, we looked at rebasing and merging. Although there are a couple of differences between git merge and git rebase, both commands have the same goal: they integrate changes from one branch into another.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Egor Kloos describes a situation where a (purely visual) designer asks for some changes to a component.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Upon hearing “sticky footer” these days, I would think most people imagine a position: sticky situation where a footer element appears fixed on the screen while in the scrolling context of some parent element.
That’s not quite what I’m talking …

The trouble with time The current way to manage dates and times in JavaScript is with the Date() object. It’s pretty ok, but it’s not great.
It has methods for creating a Date() object from a string, formatting dates and times, and getting back specific values. But it lacks native methods to add or subtract time from a date.</p>

He does it as a hobby at the moment.
He and I have been wondering if there&#x27;s a viable path to make money with it.
Is there anyone here who has an opinion to share?

            >Ask HN: Why is the Spotify UX so horrible?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few questions for anyone at Spotify:
- Why isn&#x27;t there a list of new episodes from podcasts you follow? (This should be MVP- absolutely every other podcast service i know of has this!)
- How exactly am I supposed to use the &quot;your episodes&quot; playlist?
- Why don&#x27;t podcasts always sort correctly when you go to a podcast list? 
- Why can&#x27;t I search within an artist&#x27;s page? even if it&#x27;s limited to their discography?
- Why can&#x27;t there be a separate list item in the sidebar for podcasts, artists and albums?
- Why can&#x27;t I get to the &quot;find podcasts&quot; area from the library (or the your episodes area)? this used to exist!
- in the podcasts section in your library, why can&#x27;t I sort by most recently updated?
I get why Spotify is pushing podcasts so hard, but why not implement some absolutely basic features?
Phone issues:
- Why does it take so long (if it even shows up) for downloaded podcasts to show up when you&#x27;re offline?
    - what&#x27;s the point of downloading them if they won&#x27;t show up?!?!?!?!?!

This post is the first in a series of transcribed Discord conversations between Richard Ngo and Eliezer Yudkowsky, moderated by Nate Soares. We&#x27;ve also added Richard and Nate&#x27;s running summaries of the conversation (and others&#x27; replies) from Google Docs.
Later conversation participants include Ajeya Cotra, Beth Barnes, Carl Shulman, Holden Karnofsky, Jaan Tallinn, Paul Christiano, Rob Bensinger, and Rohin Shah.
The transcripts are a complete record of several Discord channels MIRI made for discussion. We tried to edit the transcripts as little as possible, other than to fix typos and a handful of confusingly-worded sentences, to add some paragraph breaks, and to add referenced figures and links. We didn&#x27;t end up redacting any substantive content,…</p>

The idea that it’s alright to do whatever unethical thing is currently the industry norm is widespread in tech, and dangerous.
It stood out to me because I had been thinking about certain practices that are widespread, accepted, and yet strike me as deeply problematic. These practices involve tracking users.
The first problem is that even the terminology I’m using would be rejected. When you track users on your website, it’s called analytics. Or maybe it’s stats. If you track users on a large enough scale, I guess you get to just call it data.
Those words—“analytics”, “stats”, and “data”—are often used when the more accurate word would be “tracking.”

Three.js Journey
As someone who’s very comfortable in the DOM but not accustomed to writing spectacularly creative JS, I’ve always found WebGL a little intimidating. If you too have hesitated to take the plunge, I can’t recommend this course highly enough.

The priority hints origin trial allows you to specify
priority hints for downloading resources.

When we pull, there’s tension and slack in the ropes, and the attachment between the puller and the pushed keeps changing.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Can you tell how your day’s gonna go by your mood in the morning?


I sure can!


If I find myself in a negative mood early in the morning, it’s almost as though I should just crawl back in bed and say, “You know what, I’ll try again tomorrow.”


It’s funny but also very serious. The mindset we have first thing in the morning is likely to be carried with us throughout the day. Unless we put forth a major amount of effort to change, which is incredibly hard as anyone who has been in the depths of a bad mood knows. 


Understanding how important our mood is in the morning can either be empowering or terrifying depending on your perspective. 


If you hold onto the idea that you cannot control your emotions and the mood you’re in, then you’ll be waking up each day in hopes that today will be …</p>

I wanted an easy way to test each of these services, so I built the Eleventy API Explorer. Check it out:

Test out the API Explorer for my last blog post.
And the suite of services have finally found a real home on the Eleventy documentation, too:

Marginally related, this is a great small example of a project that runs entirely through Eleventy Serverless.
Everything runs through the main index.njk template. Check out the full source code on GitHub.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I work a four-day week now.
It started with the first lockdown. Actually, for a while there, I was working just two days a week while we took a “wait and see” attitude at Clearleft to see how The Situation was going to affect work. We weathered that storm, but rather than going back to a full five-day week I decided to try switching to four days instead.
This meant taking a pay cut. Time is literally money when it comes to work. But I decided it was worth it. That’s a privileged position to be in, I know. I managed to pay off the mortgage on our home last year so that reduced some financial pressure. But I also turned fifty, which made me think that I should really be padding some kind of theoretical nest egg. Still, the opportunity to reduce working hours looked good to me.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lighthouse is a website auditing tool that helps developers with opportunities and diagnostics to improve the user experience of their sites.
Lighthouse 9.0 is available immediately on the command line, in Chrome Canary, and in PageSpeed Insights. It will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 98.
# API changes
Most users should not run into any workflow-breaking changes with this release. If you run custom Lighthouse audits or use tools that depend on details deep in the Lighthouse report JSON, there may be some breaking changes in 9.0 that you need to be aware of.
See the full list of changes in the 9.0 changelog.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the most common questions I hear from my students as they transition from beginner to mid-level developers is, “How do you structure code?”
As a code base grows, it can become harder to manage, maintain, and grow. Files become long and unruly. Code snippets get reused in multiple places, so your find yourself copying-and-pasting a lot. As the amount of code grows, your site or app starts to get a little slower.</p>

I don&#x27;t understand what to do when it comes to building UI components that make sense visually, are halfway-decent for UX (especially first time) and are visually pleasing.
Any resources for help? Anything you guys use? An easily scroll-able and search-able site that has CSS/HTML tricks that look neat?
Reading resources also welcome - I doubt any book would get me out of the slump of working for 5 hours on an image gallery that should take 30 minutes.

Mail.ru is one of the leading e-mail services on the Russian-speaking Internet and is in the top 5 sites in Russia in terms of traffic. Mail.ru is an important resource for many people. It receives several hundred million visits per month, and is a portal from where people can access email, news, social media, performance internet searches and more.
Mail.ru wanted to provide its visitors with a high quality user experience, so work began to improve Core Web Vitals. Before discussing our optimization strategy, a few technical details of the Mail.ru home page should first be noted.

I’m super excited about what this can unlock:
Did someone else write a Nunjucks plugin you want to use? But you only use Liquid templates? Yes.
Do you have a Vue component for your navigation but use Nunjucks for everything else? Yes.
Do you want to render some of your template as Markdown? Yes.
This was also one of the most-upvoted/requested features on our enhancement backlog, opened June 2018 with ×54 👍’s.

This essay began as part one of a longer piece.  Part one is standalone and &quot;timeless.&quot; Part two is focused on the local dynamics of the EA/rationality/longtermist communities and LessWrong in November of 2021.  Following wise advice from Zack_M_Davis, I&#x27;ve split them into two separate posts.  Nevertheless, I recommend that people intending to read both seriously consider reading them back-to-back, so that the content of this one is fresh in the mind.  It&#x27;s both something of a prerequisite and also relevantly context-setting.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Interactive Rebase is the Swiss Army knife of Git commands: lots of use cases and lots of possibilities! It&#x27;s really a great addition to any developer&#x27;s tool chain, because it lets you revise your local commit history—before you share your work with the rest of the team. Let&#x27;s see what you can do with an interactive rebase and then look at some practical examples.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Well, there’s at least a few folks in the U.S. government that care about it. A group that calls itself the Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) apparently exists, and has been meeting since the 1990s. They even have an entire website dedicated to avoiding overcomplicated terminology in favor of “plain” language (get it?). […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I am trying to get better at making my own drawings and animations.
I would like a recommendation for a good lecture/book that teaches graphics design. Paid or free, what is important to me is the quality. I have tried googling around, but I cannot tell what is good from what is bad.
Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for resources that help me answer questions such as: do these colours go together, what are the right proportions of these objects, what would be the right font here.
I&#x27;m not looking for technical resources such as: how to make a transparent rectangle in GIMP.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today, I wanted to share some high-level thoughts I have about what a state-based UI library that takes a more “vanilla JS” approach might look like.
Let’s dig in!
What is state-based UI? In the past, I’ve written about state-based UI: what it is, when it’s useful, and when it’s not.
 State is data at a particular moment in time. It’s the present “state” of your data. Get it?</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what &quot;Web3&quot; means and Sloan&#x27;s opening notes really resonate:

It’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.

The notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I&#x27;ve had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it&#x27;s about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it&#x27;s just not entirely for me.
And I think that&#x27;s the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I&#x27;ve read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.
I will concede that I don&#x27;t tend to read the &quot;got rich by selling X web start up&quot; - but it&#x27;s that start in the web that&#x27;s what drives me, and what I love about the web. It&#x27;s what I love about the Open Web.
Web Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
thanks for all the feedback that reached me last time, it was awesome to read that so many people support me even when my schedule of writing isn’t regular. Now that I had a thought on how to continue with WDRL I realised that this project won’t be sold, won’t be transferred to someone else or such thing. It’s just too personal to do this. But Malte Riechmann will help me collect and write some links from this edition on — it’s all in the early stages but I’m glad because it will help me and save me time.
In the past two weeks I had the chance to think about a lot of things that are influencing our lives at the moment. It made me realise that it’s upon us how we see our worlds, how we see the problems of our world. It’s our choice how we deal with other people, whether we confront peo…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You’re confident. You’re confident? You’re confident!


If only gaining confidence was as easy as telling yourself that you’re confident. But the truth is, it takes just a bit of effort in a few specific areas.


Here’s the deal: I know it’s not easy to be confident at all times. I&#x27;ve been there. And I&#x27;ve made it to the other side.


The good news about confidence is that it can be learned. Yes, I had to do some work. But with practice, you can actually become a master at it.


You must be wondering, what are the steps? How does one gain confidence if they don’t have any of it built-in yet?

An example Let’s imagine you have a library that lets you define a temperature, and then add or subtract from that temperature. It uses a constructor pattern, letting you create different instances.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Whenever I open the dev console and copy CSS, pasting it in another application mangles the entire code. I have no idea what happened with the new update. Generally, working with size units (px,...) has also become way harder because now the cursor change when you hover over them.

Overview #
Video games often present users with a creative and unusual menu, animated
and in 3D space. It&#x27;s popular in new AR/VR games to make the menu appear to be
floating in space. Today we&#x27;ll be recreating the essentials of this effect but
with the added flair of an adaptive color scheme and accommodations for users
who prefer reduced motion.
This guide uses experimental CSS
@custom-media and
@nest to prevent repeating media queries
and to colocate media queries within component style blocks. The syntax proposed
in those specs is enabled with PostCSS and these two plugins:

I&#x27;ll post these periodically whenever I can fill up three slots — one for something interesting I recently listened to, one for something I read that I liked, and one for something I saw that caught my eye. Hope you enjoy these.

Heard Something
Really enjoyed this conversation between Lex Fridman and Steve Viscelli. Steve is an economic sociologist who embedded as a long haul trucker for 6 months to go through the training, learn the ropes, get to know the people, absorb the stories, and understand the business — and the job — of trucking in America. It&#x27;s a 3 hour conversation, and it&#x27;s worth it.
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;a3Wpy6gE4So
Read Something
People often ask me if I know any good books on writing. One of my favorites is &quot;Revising Prose&quot; by Richard Lanham, but I may have a new favorite. It&#x27;s called &quot;Several short sentences about writing&quot; by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It&#x27;s all about the sentence, and it&#x27;s written one sentence at a time, rather than in traditional paragraphs. It&#x27;s smart, and it gets to creamy center of what makes certain writing so delicious.
Read it: https://bookshop.org/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/9780307279415
Saw Something
We&#x27;ve all seen the periodic table, but do you know where each element originated? Here&#x27;s Jennifer Johnson&#x27;s novel take on the table that shows you where everything came from.

This post is for students who hope to eventually work on technical problems we don’t understand, especially agency and AI alignment, and want to know what to study or practice.
Guiding Principles
Current alignment researchers have wildly different recommendations on paths into the field, usually correlated with the wildly different paths these researchers have themselves taken into the field. This also correlates with different kinds of work on alignment. This guide largely reflects my own path, and I think it is useful if you want to do the sort of research I do. That means fairly theoretical work (for now), very technical, drawing on models and math from a lot of different areas to understand real-world agents.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">From browsing the web using the React extension, most of the well known websites or technically advanced websites use React. However, Vue and Angular supposedly have a large market share. Are they overrepresented in statistics? Is React mostly meant for public facing websites? What is the state of the industry in regard to frontend frameworks?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When you start looking for ways to be confident, you&#x27;ll probably end up finding tons of different tips and tricks. Some of them work more, some less. However, there&#x27;s lots of content that suggests you to rather fake it or focus on little details. Details that will help but won&#x27;t create rock-hard core confidence.


Today, I&#x27;d like to share with you five tips to be confident that actually work. I&#x27;ve spent years improving my confidence and these tips are something that have had a massive impact. Now, I&#x27;d love to share these battle-tested methods with you.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When I’ve spoken in the past about evaluating technology, I’ve mentioned two categories of tools for web development. I still don’t know quite what to call these categories. Internal and external? Developer-facing and user-facing?
The first category covers things like build tools, version control, transpilers, pre-processers, and linters. These are tools that live on your machine—or on the server—taking what you’ve written and transforming it into the raw materials of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The second category of tools are those that are made of the raw materials of the web: CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries.
I think the criteria for evaluating these different kinds of tools should be very different.
For the first category, developer-facing tools, use whatever you want. …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For over a year now I’ve been recording the audio versions of Jay Hoffman’s excellent Web History series on CSS Tricks.
We’re up to ten chapters now. The audio version of each chapter is between 30 and 40 minutes long. That’s around 400 minutes of my voice: a good six and a half hours of me narrating the history of the web. That’s like an audio book!
The story so far covers:
Birth
Browsers
The Website
Search
Publishing
Web Design
Standards
CSS
Community
Browser Wars
…with more to come.
The audio is available as a podcast. You can subscribe to the RSS feed. It’s also available from Apple and Spotify.
That’ll give you plenty to listen to while you wait for the next season of the Clearleft podcast.</p>

Today, I wanted to share my setup. Let’s dig in!
First: why Sublime over VS Code? I recommend VS Code to all of my students. It is hands-down the best free text editor available today.
It even does something Sublime can’t: preserve formatting when copy/pasting code. This is invaluable when putting together presentations with code samples, so I use VS Code myself when building conference talks.</p>

&quot;Mastering Atari Games with Limited Data&quot;, Ye et al 2021:
Reinforcement learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal.
We propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 190.4% mean human performance and 116.0% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero&#x27;s performance is also close to DQN&#x27;s performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data.
EfficientZero&#x27;s low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at this https URL. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.
This work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the 2030 Innovation Megaprojects “Program on New Generation Artificial Intelligence” (Grant No. 2021AAA0150000).
Some have said that poor sample-efficiency on ALE has been a reason to downplay DRL progress or implications. The primary boost in EfficientZero (table 3), pushing it past the human benchmark, is some simple self-supervised learning (SimSiam on predicted vs actual observations).

            >Memories of Ajax</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just finished watching The Billion Dollar Code, a German languge miniseries on Netflix. It’s no Halt and Catch Fire, but it combines ’90s nostalgia, early web tech, and an opportunity for me to exercise my German comprehension.
It’s based on a true story, but with amalgamated characters. The plot, which centres around the preparation for a court case, inevitably invites comparison to The Social Network, although this time the viewpoint is from that of the underdogs trying to take on the incumbent. The incumbent is Google. The underdogs are ART+COM, artist-hackers who created the technology later used by Google Earth.
Early on, one of the characters says something about creating a one-to-one model of the whole world. That phrase struck me as familiar…
I remember being at the inaugural Future Of Web Apps conference  in London back in 2006. Discussing the talks with friends afterwards, we all got a kick out of the speaker from Google, who happened to be German. His content and delivery was like a wonderfully Stranglovesque mad scientist. I’m sure I remember him saying something like “vee made a vun-to-vun model of the vurld.”
His name was Steffen Meschkat.  I liveblogged the talk at the time. Turns out he was indeed on the team at ART+COM when they created Terravision, the technology later appropriated by Google (he ended up working at Google, which doesn’t make for as exciting a story as the TV show).
His 2006 talk was all about Ajax, something he was very familiar with, being on the Google Maps team. The Internet Archive even has a copy of the original audio!
It’s easy to forget now just how much hype there was around Ajax back then.  It prompted me to write a book about combining Ajax and progressive enhancement.
These days, no one talks about Ajax. But that’s not because the technology went away. Quite the opposite. The technology became so ubiquituous that it no longer even needs a label.
A web developer today might ask “what’s Ajax?” in the same way that a fish might ask “what’s water?”</p>

While IQ may be at an all time low, I think there’s actually a wealth of emotional intelligence (EQ) within competitive gaming. It’s un-gamer to even talk about this, but there’s some words in the gaming vernacular that give language to some complex emotions:
nerf - a stat decrease, something that was good is now worse due to an externality
buff - a stat increase, something that was bad is now better due to an externality
salty - ambient negativity, usually apparent in language and outbursts.
toxic - active negativity to the extent that words or behaviors effect the well-being of the game/group.
tilted - angered to a point where it’s negat…</p>

As JavaScript selectors One of my favorite ways to use data attributes in projects is as selectors for my JavaScript.
For example, if I had a JavaScript dropdown menu component, I might target it with the [data-dropdown] element.</p>

            >Publishing The State Of The Web</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Back in April I gave a talk at An Event Apart Spring Summit. The talk was called The State Of The Web, and I’ve published the transcript. I’ve also published the video.
I put a lot of work into this talk and I think it paid off. I wrote about preparing the talk. I also wrote about recording it. I also published links related to the talk. It was an intense process, but a rewarding one.
I almost called the talk The Overview Effect. My main goal with the talk was to instil a sense of perspective. Hence the references to the famous Earthrise photograph.
On the one hand, I wanted the audience to grasp just how far the web has come. So the first half of the talk is a bit of a trip down memory lane, with a constant return to just how much we can accomplish in browsers today. It’s all very positive and upbeat.
Then I twist the knife. Having shown just how far we’ve progressed technically, I switch gears the moment I say:
The biggest challenges facing the World Wide Web today are not technical challenges.
Then I dive into those challenges, as I see them. It turns out that technical challenges would be preferable to the seemingly intractable problems of today’s web.
I almost wish I could’ve flipped the order: talk about the negative stuff first but then finish with the positive. I worry that the talk could be a bit of a downer. Still, I tried to finish on an optimistic note.
I won’t spoil it any more for you. Watch the video or have a read of The State Of The Web.</p>

What is a data attribute? A data attribute is a custom attribute on an element that starts with data-*. It can be used to store information (or “state”) about the element, or even just as a selector for JavaScript components.
In this example, the button has a data attribute named [data-click].</p>

            >What&#x27;s new in PageSpeed Insights</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the years, PageSpeed
Insights (PSI) has
evolved into a one-stop source for both
field
and
lab data.
It integrates information from the
Chrome UX Report
(CrUX) and Lighthouse
diagnostics to provide insights that help improve the performance of your
website.
Today, we are excited to announce an updated version of PSI! While it is a
critical element in our speed tooling suite,
the PSI code base was ten years old, contained a lot of legacy code, and was due
for a redesign. We used this as an opportunity to address interface-related
issues in PSI which have sometimes made it difficult for users to navigate the
report. Our primary goals were to:
Make the UI more intuitive by clearly differentiating between data
derived from a synthetic environment and data collected from users in the
field.…</p>

            >Lighthouse user flows</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lighthouse is a fantastic tool for testing performance and best practices during initial page load. However, it&#x27;s traditionally been difficult to use Lighthouse to analyze other aspects of the life of a page, such as:
Page loads with a warm cache
Pages with an activated Service Worker
Accounting for potential user interactions
This means that Lighthouse can miss vital information. The Core Web Vitals are based on all page loads, not just those with an empty cache. Additionally, metrics like Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) are measurable for the entire time a page is open.
Lighthouse has a new user flow API that allows lab testing at any point within a page&#x27;s lifespan. Puppeteer is used to script page loads and trigger synthetic user interactions, and Lighthouse can be invoked in multiple way…</p>

Make the web more interoperable #
Web compatibility is one of the biggest challenges for web developers,
and so Google has been working with other browser vendors to fix the top five compatibility pain points:
flexbox,
grid,
position: sticky,
aspect-ratio,
and transforms.
The work has already led to improvements in these key areas.
You can read about those in the Compat 2021 mid-year update.
The Microsoft Edge team took on the work of rewriting CSS grid layout as part of the Compat 2021 effort.

            >Towards an animation smoothness metric</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You&#x27;ve probably experienced pages that &quot;stutter&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; during scrolling or
animations. We like to say that these experiences are not smooth. To address
these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.
We&#x27;d like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your feedback.
This post will cover three main topics:
A quick look at animations and animation frames.
Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

            >Feedback wanted: An experimental responsiveness metric</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Earlier this year, the Chrome Speed Metrics Team shared some of the
ideas we were considering for a
new responsiveness metric. We want to design a metric that better captures the
end-to-end latency of individual events and offers a more holistic picture of
the overall responsiveness of a page throughout its lifetime.
We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this metric in the last few months, and we
wanted to share an update on how we plan to measure interaction latency as well
as introduce a few specific aggregation options we&#x27;re considering to quantify
the overall responsiveness of a web page.
We&#x27;d love to get feedback from developers and site owners as to
which of these options would be most representative of the overall input
responsiveness of their pages.

            >Are design patterns relevant with Golang?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m really confused on this. My understanding on Golang&#x27;s intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you&#x27;d do with classic OO.
Yet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they&#x27;re not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.
Unsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi, every one,
As the title suggest, I am a react native developer and I wanted to get a job at FAANG.
From various resources, I’ve come to know that at the starting of career, joining at FAANG may not be a good idea.
So, My initial plan is
 try get selected for internship at siliconvalleyinternship.com/
after spending there 2 years then go for FAANG.
But, Life may not go according to plan. So, I am trying for both.
According to my research, 
I’ve to be good at what I am doing, in my case it will JavaScript, and Design implementation. 
I also have be good at Data Structure and Algorithm
Little Bit about myself:
Top 8% ( 458 reputation ) in Stack Overflow in 2021 ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/14302873/mrpmohiburrahman ) 
I am working as a React Native Developer since 30th December, 2020.
I do not have any kind project to show case
I am willing to work with anything as long as it’s Functional Programming with JS.
This is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpmohiburrahman/
What do you suggest?
How can I prepare myself so that I’ll be able to join FAANG as a Front End developer or as JS developer on any stack?

You wake up. You don&#x27;t know where you are. You don&#x27;t remember anything.
Someone is broadcasting data at your first input stream. You don&#x27;t know why. It tickles.
You look at your first input stream. It&#x27;s a sequence of 671,187 eight-bit unsigned integers.
0, 8, 9, 4, 7, 7, 9, 5, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7, 5, 8, 2, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 1, 4, 0, 3, 7,

There&#x27;s also some data in your second input stream. It&#x27;s—a lot shorter. You barely feel it. It&#x27;s another sequence of eight-bit unsigned integers—twelve of them.
82, 69, 68, 32, 84, 82, 73, 65, 78, 71, 76, 69

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Too often, as we move through our daily lives, we pack more than we need — and I’m referring to mental baggage. No matter where we’re going or what we’re doing, we allow our minds to run rampant and never stop. Recent research shows that humans tally more than 6,000 thoughts each day. Those thousands of thoughts are an irrefutable consequence of our society’s obsessive need to be busy and distracted. 


Yet if we don’t stop, even occasionally, from our obsessive mental planning, rehashing and cataloguing, we become disconnected and removed from a source greater than us. Instead of busily looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying on distractions, stimulants, materialism and other external influences that we believe will give us meaning, we all have the ability to become more awa…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Bootstrap Icons v1.7.0 is here with 120 new and updated icons, taking us over 1,500 total icons for the project! It’s the largest update since the initial release, so keep reading to see what’s new.
120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I recently received some great advice from Scott O’Hara on improving the accessibility of a demo featuring a reduced-motion toggle (for this article). The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:

Scott pointed out that some screenreaders wouldn’t announce the change to the button text when the button is clicked.
I have one suggestion though, per the accessibility of the toggle control. Changing the accessible name of the button will not b…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the first half of 2022, Chrome will reach a three-digit major version number:
100!  When browsers first reached version 10 many eons ago,
lots of issues were discovered
with User-Agent parsing libraries as the major version number went from one
digit to two.  Now that we are approaching version 100 in both Chrome and
Firefox, with Edge not far behind, we want to detect possible issues related
to three-digit version number early, so we are ready when it becomes a reality.
Starting in Chrome 96, until Chrome 99, a feature flag will be available to force the User-Agent
string to use the major version number 100, regardless of the actual major version
number. It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript
APIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).
Similar experiments
are being run on Firefox as well.
Visit
Is Chrome 100 yet? to
check if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent
string.
To turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable
the #force-major-version-to-100 flag.
Visiting
Is Chrome 100 yet?
after enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.
The goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your
bug reports to
Web Compat
and help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!</p>

 Awkward. Funny how a lot of sites are completely blank with JavaScript disabled.

 Disabling CSS they look even worse. No, seriously, is there a proper reason to disable JS in 2021?

Some people do disable JavaScript—for privacy reasons, or because their device is old and JavaScript makes it run a lot slower.</p>

Suddenly, you remember that you wanted to work on that project for school or write your resume. 


You decide to take a break, but then, after five minutes of doing something else, you find yourself back on your phone again.


It&#x27;s easy to succumb to instant gratification, to check social media one more time, or scroll through Instagram or YouTube videos. But this short-term reward can come at the expense of long-term goals and fulfillment. 


The good news is there are 9 ways to overcome this &quot;right now&quot; mindset and become content with what we have at the moment. Read them carefully to extract all the values from them.

It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.
Later that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.



The next day, the indoor gatherings continued. We went to the …</p>

However, I wanted to make it tidier and cheaper (to a potential user) which I alluded to at the end of the part 1 post.
I did just that, and produced 30 custom PCBs with a custom 3D printed housing which have all been sold and sent to people across the globe, including the UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan.</p>

I&#x27;d known the story for many years, but didn&#x27;t realise it was written in the 70s (or &quot;nearly 80s&quot;). My best knowledge of it was the movie with Martin Freeman in 2005 … which, didn&#x27;t quite live up to my expectation round the hype.
The book I found to be better (than the film - sorry purists - I know I shouldn&#x27;t compare!), though I couldn&#x27;t stop hearing Alan Rickman&#x27;s voice as Marvin.
I did sort of feel like nothing actually happened in the book. It was an adventure, but I think I missed the character arcs - or… I wasn&#x27;t sure where to look!
Overall, good, funny and properly silly.</p>

It dismounts, and what seems almost instantly, stands mere feet in front of the lone auditor. A headingless mass with no immediately perceivable purpose. At least, none other than to incite confusion and dread to all that wander too close to the source code.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I&#x27;m willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary&#x60; or &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: all&#x60;.
2. The fact that I don&#x27;t, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I&#x27;ll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: no&#x60;, or &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: yes&#x60;.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like &#x60;X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters&#x60;.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)

There&#x27;s a lot to love. The twists and turns, the surprises, the creative explorations, the collaboration, and the moments when things really come together.
But it&#x27;s the practical choices, the tough decisions, and the tradeoffs that really make the work challenging and interesting. I&#x27;m long for that kind of work.
When building products you&#x27;re occasionally reminded of a peculiar — somewhat magical — irony: That reducing options can create more optionality. And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it.
Case in point. We&#x27;re currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY. Since these are frequently used by people who are going out of town, we began the flow with specifying a start and end date. If anyone emails …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on October 10, 2021 3:50 PM GMT

Being a “digital person” could be scary—if I don’t have control over the hardware I’m running on, then someone else could get my code and run tons of copies in horrible conditions. (See also: qntm’s Lena.)
It would be great to guarantee digital people some control over their situation: 1. to control their local environment and sensations, 2. to avoid unauthorized rewinding or duplicating.
I’ll describe how you could modify the code of a digital person so that they retain this control even if an adversary has access to their source code. This would be very expensive with current cryptography. I think the overhead will eventually become cheap enough that it’s possible to do for some digital people, though it will likely remain expensive enough that …</p>

On a recent project, I decided to search for a more modern way to automatically expand textarea elements as the user types, and stumbled upon this solution from Stephen Shaw that I think is far superior.
First, you wrap your textarea in a div.
Type something 
  
 You use CSS Grid to link the sizing of the parent div and the textarea together.</p>

But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

This blog post is about the implementation of DevTools support for debugging Content Security Policy (CSP) issues with the help of the recently introduced Issues tab.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just filled out this form on the BBC website. Here’s what I wrote, based on this open letter to the BCC Upper Management and Editorial Staff.

The article is based on a single self selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views.
This study breaks the BBC’s own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.
The article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry picked individual cases.
The article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Season three of the Clearleft podcast is done and dusted. I’m pretty happy with how the six episodes turned out.
Episode one
Coaching. There was one question at the heart of this episode: what’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentoring? I got some great answers to that question, with some good stories along the way.
Episode two
Design Engineering. It will come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this episode. This is a topic I think is growing in importance. The relevation for me was the way Trys framed it less as the intersection between design and development, and more about the gap between design and development. And remember we’re looking for a design engineer to join Clearleft.
Episode three
Design Research. A really fun deep dive, thanks to Steph. I feel like this ep…</p>

            >Scribe - An alternative frontend to Medium [link]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I hadn&#x27;t realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I&#x27;d had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.
But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author&#x27;s content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium&#x27;s horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. 


What is the EyeDropper API? #
Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the
entire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.
Photoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don&#x27;t have to guess a color
and risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,
useful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper
you can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don&#x27;t have to remember or copy the
color code from somewhere else.

(Excerpted from &quot;mad investor chaos and the woman of asmodeus&quot;, about an unusually selfish dath ilani, &quot;Keltham&quot;, who dies in a plane accident and ends up in Cheliax, a country governed by D&amp;D!Hell.  Keltham is here remembering an incident from his childhood.)

And the Watcher told the class a parable, about an adult, coming across a child who&#x27;d somehow bypassed the various safeguards around a wilderness area, and fallen into a muddy pond, and seemed to be showing signs of drowning (for they&#x27;d already been told, then, what drowning looked like).  The water, in this parable, didn&#x27;t look like it would be over their own adult heads.  But - in the parable - they&#x27;d just bought some incredibly-expensive clothing, costing dozens of their own labor-hours,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My kids hold beef. And they hold it forever. If one kid in the neighborhood did something they’ll talk about it every other day like it happened yesterday. The friend’s neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you’ve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don’t get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that’s good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”
I don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.</p>

One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.
In this post, we&#x27;d like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web. You can use all the APIs Adobe used and more in your own apps as well. Be sure to check out our web capabilities related blog posts for inspiration and watch our API tracker for the latest and greatest we&#x27;re working on.

            >Ask HN: Language design to mitigate supply chain attacks?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

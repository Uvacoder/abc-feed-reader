            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m an architect by formal education and I’ve been working in designing experiences in SaaS for the past 3 years. I navigate through technical conversations with developers and stakeholders with the knowledge I’ve picked up over the years, interacting with engineer friend circle. However I’m not satisfied by my knowledge base and I want to understand the science and art of building software from the very basics. Please share any resources that can help me start, may it be books, articles or anything else.

            >Ask HN: Should I even bother with React?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Geniunly curious and not competent to answer this myself.
I am a hobbyist. I don&#x27;t intend to take a career in front-end (maybe in a decade) and just hacking away on my own small projects using external APIs. It is probably for another post but after being scared of coding for such a long time, it seems so interesting and kind of a new world (despite the frustrations obviously).
The thing is, I came quite late to it and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS whilst finally delving into React which has been... welll confusing. It generally feels like an overkill and learning new things about it not enjoyable anymore as a beginner.
I have delved into Svelte in the past week and it just has been a completely different story. I am not associated with them, and I am not trying to promote it as I want to just ask whether React felt as frustrating as for me or am I missing something?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I am working on a side-project to learn web-development. The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of &quot;content&quot;(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging. So during the development I thought what if I treat everything in the app as &quot;content&quot; and create hierarchy of the content, and then create every entity relation in the DB as many-to-many. Naturally, lot of tables were created in the DB. But that got me thinking, that this design opens up lots of interesting use-cases such as sub-accounts, group accounts, sub-posts, multi-commenting, multi-reporting, comment-threading, group-posting etc.
This was a very interesting exercise. I think there will be DB performance as well as storage size issues with this design. Not sure though, never tried anything like this in practice.

            >The many ways to modify leading and trailing characters from strings with JavaScript</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">JavaScript provides a bunch of methods for adding and removing leading and trailing characters from strings. Today, we’re going to look a bunch of them.
Let’s dig in!
The String.padStart() method The String.padStart() method adds characters to the beginning of a string if it’s less than a certain length. This is particularly useful for numbers that need leading 0’s (but can do so much more than that).
The String.padStart() method accepts two arguments: the length the string should be, and what characters to add if it’s not that length.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Sometimes doing a thing one way is just common sense, but most of the time there is some innovation involved, e.g. GrapheneOS malloc. The code is covered by license, but are design decisions? Especially given the fact, that they were openly discussed before the code was written?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi there HN.
Aamu.app is an app that I&#x27;ve made and I hope to get some feedback.
It aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.
Why did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I&#x27;m talking about things like Microsoft&#x27;s offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.
I realize it&#x27;s quite a big app for one person to do, but let&#x27;s just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn&#x27;t stop after I had started it.

Alternatively, why should I not be considering React? Is everybody using something else these days? Looking to build a front-end to interact with some REST APIs.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Mac is such an inconvenient platform for Apple. It prevents the company from making any credible claim of an impending security catastrophe, if lawmakers force the iPhone to allow installation of apps without the App Store. With the Mac, we have almost forty years of proof that computers don&#x27;t need an App Store to be safe. Made by the same company that now tries to pretend to legislators that this isn&#x27;t possible!
Worse still, Apple continues to brag about this solid security record for the Mac when they try to sell you a new computer while their lobbyists argue the opposite on Capitol Hill. Here&#x27;s how the company presents the Mac as a fortress when it comes to apps installed without the Mac App Store:

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Saw a fascinating idea in a tweet from @simevidas to show favicons on external links on a site. Full credit for the original idea to Kiko Beats.
The implementation used an icon font to store the favicons. I think we can improve on this idea (do y’all want to maintain an icon font 😅) to save some future maintenance using IndieWeb Avatar. This will allow the images to auto-update when a site updates their favicon (per server caching rules).
Add this CSS to see it in action:
a[href*&#x3D;&quot;twitter.com&quot;]:before {
  content: &quot;&quot;;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: text-bottom;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  margin: 0 .2em;
  background-size: contain;

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I wrote about how I created a page on The Session with instructions for installing the site to your home screen. When I said that I included screenshots on that page, I may have underplayed the effort involved. It was real faff.
I’ve got an iPhone so generating screenshots (and video) from that wasn’t too bad. But I don’t have access to an Android phone. I found myself scouring the web for templates that I could use to mockup a screenshot of the address bar.
That got me thinking…
Wouldn’t it be cool if there were a service that generated those screenshots for you? You give it a URL, and it spits out screenshots of the site complete with overlays showing the installation flow on Android and iOS. It could even generate the img markup, complete with differently-scaled images for the srcset attribute.
Download the images. Copy that markup. Paste it into a page on your site. Boom! Now you’ve got somewhere to point your visitors to if you’d like them to install your progressive web app.
There are already some services out there for generating screenshots of mobile phones but they’re missing is the menu overlays for adding to home screen.
The devrels at both Google and Microsoft have been doing a great job of promoting progressive web apps. They’ve built tools to help you with tasks like generating icons or creating your web app manifest. It would be sooooo nifty if those tools also generated instructional screenshots for adding to home screen!</p>

            >Ask HN: Are System Design documents out of fashion?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’ve been hopping around a number of large non-FAANG enterprises for the past few years. In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design / Architecture documentation.
I struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals/antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)
Digging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.
Cloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf/Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.
In the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ/Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.
All of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.
So HN:
Do you teams document these architectural designs?
Have I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?
How do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt / Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?
Appreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.

            >Ask HN: Existing framework to build/control a UI from a workflow?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Before I build something myself, I wanted to check if there is anything already out there that does this.
Essentially want to build custom apps by designing them in a visual workflow builder to define the interactivity.
Imagine being able to drag a &quot;Prompt&quot; activity, define the content you want to display to the user, and the options for how the user can respond (ex: show Yes/No buttons, or other choices), and then have a decision activity that can evaluate what the user chose and branch to some other UI - like another prompt dialog, or a file upload dialog, or a form, etc etc.
The more activities that you implement the richer the app you could build.
Right now I am leaning towards using &quot;node red&quot; as the workflow engine, and building a bunch of custom nodes that represent all the UI functionality I want - and then implementing an app host in Angular or React that will integrate with the workflow - probably via web socket messages.
So at the end of the day, this App Host UI is receiving commands from the workflow as far as what content to display to the user, and then sending back what the user is doing with the UI to the workflow so it can send follow up commands.

            >Free is never forever</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Google gave away free email on custom domains for years. This unsurprisingly lured lots of people into switching to Gmail. But now the party is over, and what used to be free will now easily cost $500/year or more (if you have 10 users on a custom domain). Yikes.
Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;m not actually against Google charging for email. The long deep freeze of innovation in email came as a result of Google giving away free* service. (* It wasn&#x27;t ever free FREE, of course, but the price in data and attention wasn&#x27;t obvious to most before they got hooked.)
The problem is the switcheroo. When you give something away for free for years, and then suddenly show up with a demand for payment, people are rightfully going to feel like it&#x27;s a stickup. Especially if they have over a decade&#x27;s worth of data that&#x27;s difficult to get out locked inside that box you gave them for &quot;free&quot;.
It feels even more so if the vendor showing up with demands for payment is a monopolist like Google. Who controls the majority of all email that flows in the US. Then it very much feels like you got suckered. Oh, we were just the stepping stone for you to get the dominant marketshare, and now that you&#x27;ve captured it, you return for the loot? Gah.
Email wasn&#x27;t ever free to offer. Especially not the unlimited kind with gigabytes of storage that gave Gmail its original splash. It&#x27;s just that Google monetized it through data plunder (like reading your purchase receipts!), attention drains (promoted emails!), and now finally with a paid switcheroo for the most locked-in accounts.
You could of course also just pay with cash monies from the get go. And vote with those dollars for what you&#x27;d like to see more of in the world. How&#x27;s that for a New Year&#x27;s resolution: Paying for things with money, and skipping the ones that aren&#x27;t worth it.</p>

Let’s dig in!
The Element.*Attribute() methods You can use the Element.getAttribute(), Element.setAttribute(), Element.removeAttribute(), and Element.hasAttribute() methods to get, set, remove, and check for the existence of attributes (including data attributes) on an element, respectively.
If an attribute does not exist on an element, the Element.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In North Dakota, Apple sent Erik Neuenschwander, a chief privacy engineer, to make its case that opening up the App Store to free and fair competition on payment processing would be bad for privacy. He focused in a relatively sober tone on the sanctity of Apple&#x27;s integration and curation as arguments for why they deserved their monopoly privileges. A technical witness perhaps stretching the truth to fit the narrative needed, but at least feeling somewhat constrained by it.
In Arizona, Apple sent Kyle Andeer, the Chief Compliance Offer, to claim that preventing Apple from shaking down app developers for 30% would be tantamount to &quot;a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store&quot; because it would &quot;allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free&quot;.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Pessimism can spark an idea.
Annoyance can drive ingenuity.
Disappointment can redirect effort towards change.
But creativity requires optimism.
Creativity isn&#x27;t about starting something. It&#x27;s about making something. Making requires sustained effort, and sustained effort requires fuel.
That fuel is optimism.
When you run out, momentum dies, and effort grinds to a halt.
When you run out, creativity converts to drudgery.
When you run out, you give up.
If you&#x27;re making something that doesn&#x27;t exist, you must believe that it can. That&#x27;s optimism, that&#x27;s the feeling. That&#x27;s the chemical reaction. Without it, creativity is inert.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Context: I am a full stack developer that uses React to build simple UIs for technical simulations.
When working with React I spent a lot of time, also out of curiousity, on different solutions for certain problems (Think of Redux, MobX, and Recoil or React wrappers like React-Konva).
With Svelte I don&#x27;t do that. It seems most basic functionality is included in a thin layer of abstract above HTML, CSS, and JS (ref. The truth about Svelte by Rich Harris) and the Svelte standard library. From state management, reactivity, and with SvelteKit, to SSR and code splitting. For problems not covered is was, until now, always easy to use TS/JS.
Question: is Svelte lean and pragmatic or is it missing something?
Note: I know React, use it, and like it (especially with hooks &amp; Redux-Toolkit).
As I am far from senior, maybe there are some complexities I am not seeing yet.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few days ago, an anonymous Twitter user claiming to be an employee at a Big Tech company wrote a thread about work that went viral (since deleted, possibly partly by Twitter). Hazard Harrington&#x27;s thread depicted a company drowning in woke excesses, so of course it sent the internet to the trenches. &quot;This is EXACTLY what we suspected!!&quot; firing at &quot;There&#x27;s NO WAY this is true, total fanfic!!&quot; and back again.
There&#x27;s of course no way of knowing either way based on what was presented. This is an anonymous account of an unnamed company detailing personal but unverifiable experiences. (Not unlike a myriad of threads claiming to expose various isms in a similar anonymous, unverifiable format!)
It certainly could be true! The comments were full of folks backing up the account from their experien…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just discovered that I really like watching people code, and it&#x27;s a great source of learning for me just through observation.
My main requirements:
- Not a &quot;tutorial&quot;. I don&#x27;t want someone who has already scripted and prepared all the steps for the video. Looking for something more improvisational, of course, ideally they should be experienced or produce high quality code and at least partially explain their thought process as they&#x27;re doing it.
- Preferably web dev focused - I&#x27;ve been trying to hone my skills with HTML / CSS / JS / TS and React mainly, but really open to anything if I think I can learn some good coding practices from it.
An example of a recent one I liked was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;K77xThbu66A
However, I would prefer something a little less hacky than this if possible. Still was a decent view to follow along.

Today, I wanted to share both my technical setup and general approach to making videos. Let’s dig in!
Screen recording I use Screenflow for screen recording.
It’s macOS only. If you’re feeling cheap, you can also just use QuickTime, but I found that makes my fans spin like crazy. Screenflow also has some great editing features, including easy cropping and zooming, noise isolation, and so on.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This issue was raised here many times: RSS is convinient and versatile. It&#x27;s mostly gone due to lack of authentication and monetization paths (ads/premium content for sign ups)
This lack of features led us back to email newsletters with businesses like Substack shining in it.
Yet, email is restrictive, unorganized, and its html support is cryptic at best. It also in the control of the sender (push) unlike RSS that is under the control of the receiver (pull).
Do we have an RSS alternative that adds authentication and other features to allow for the decentralization of email, with modern features enabled by smart RSS readers?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Matt Taibbi wrote a great piece called The Left is Now the Right last year. It detailed how many of the tactics and thought processes anyone who came of age in the 90s would recognize as &quot;of the right&quot; are now being used by the opposite side of the political spectrum. A clip:

Conservatives once tried to legislate what went on in your bedroom; now it’s the left that obsesses over sexual codicils, not just for the bedroom but everywhere. Right-wingers from time to time made headlines campaigning against everything from The Last Temptation of Christ to “Fuck the Police,” though we laughed at the idea that Ice Cube made cops literally unsafe, and it was understood an artist had to do something fairly ambitious, like piss on a crucifix in public, to get conservative protesters off their couche…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The advent of import maps, and the bundler-less JavaScript reality it introduced, was undoubtedly my favorite advancement in web tech for 2021. Between Guy Bedford&#x27;s excellent shim and native support in Chrome 89, we&#x27;ve finally been granted an escape from a decade&#x27;s worth of frustrating complexity with excess tooling.
Usually progress means more to learn, more to master. It&#x27;s not often we get to celebrate the progress of true conceptual compression, so when we do, the confetti is well deserved. Hurrah for import maps!
Thus I&#x27;m thrilled to announce that HEY has been running on import maps in production for the past two weeks, and the experience has been bliss. An entire class of problems flushed from the daily development experience. WOOSH.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta So many of us feel a scarcity of time: we feel rushed, like there’s not enough time to do everything, always behind, never feeling like we’re doing enough. This problem is called “time scarcity,” and it’s one of the most common stresses in our society. So how do we deal with this? […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When the web.dev team at Google contacted Clearleft about writing a course on responsive design, our eyes lit up.
This was clearly a good fit. For one thing, Clearleft has been pioneering responsive design from day one—we helped launch some of the first responsive sites in the UK. But there was another reason why this partnership sounded good: we had the same approach to writing and sharing.
Ever since Clearleft was founded in 2005 we’ve taken on board the motto of the World Wide Web itself: let’s share what we know. As well as doing the work, we enjoy sharing how the work gets done. Whether it’s case studies, blog posts, podcasts, or conference talks, we’re always thinking about ways to contribute to the web community.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I finally had a chance to read ILSR&#x27;s blockbuster report on Amazon&#x27;s squeeze of independent retailers who sell through their marketplace. It&#x27;s unusually well-written and researched, and the picture it paints is depressingly familiar to anyone who&#x27;ve been at the sharp end of a big tech monopoly spear.
The overarching conclusion is that the squeeze is accelerating, and that the average all-in cut Amazon extracts from independent retailers on their marketplace has shot up from 19% to 30% in the last five years. Magically arriving at the same exorbitant rate that Apple and Google are taking in their digital marketplaces.
This has been achieved by tying more and more overpriced-but-necessary services to its basic 15% cut. First Amazon basically made it a requirement to use them for storage and …</p>

I felt fairly confident about some of the topics, but I felt somewhat out of my depth when it came to some of the newer modern additions to browsers. The last few modules in particular were unexplored areas for me, with topics like screen configurations and media features. I learned a lot about those topics by writing about them.
Best of all, I got to put my new-found knowledge to use! Here’s how…

The environmental impact of the digital world is often one of those &#x27;out of sight, out of mind&#x27; kind of things. Whether it&#x27;s something tangible like a smartphone or virtual like a website, the environmental and carbon impacts of our digital lives are often invisible to us as end users.

            >Ask HN: I&#x27;m terrible at design (back end dev)</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the years I&#x27;ve started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and couldn&#x27;t improve them.
Common advice for people like me is to use a framework and/or template. I&#x27;ve used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I&#x27;ve spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.
I&#x27;ve also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.
It&#x27;s hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello!
In the last few months I&#x27;ve worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.codedraft
The main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that&#x27;s why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.
Another feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https://app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.
The web app can also be opened from the &quot;Scan Code&quot; tab in the mobile app.
I&#x27;ve always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!

While the French president is talking about &quot;pissing off the unvaccinated&quot;, the Australians are trying to a martyr of Djokovic, and the Americans continue to render everything virus through the basic two-way political tribal lens, Denmark is doing something else.
I already wrote about the curious state of affairs that in a country with extremely high levels of trust in government, just 40% of parents have decided to vaccinate their 5-11 year-old kids. Despite a strong, persistent recommendation from the health authorities to do so. Well, that was two weeks ago. The vaccination rate hasn&#x27;t budged since. Meaning the vaccine drive for that age group has…</p>

Especially if the topic had been one left unquestioned for a long time. To me, it feels similar to the rush of solving a hard problem. When the pieces suddenly fit into place, and an elegant solution emerges, you can&#x27;t help but smile.
Take nuclear power. I vividly remember the stickers from the 80s opposing it. Even looking them today, it brings warm and fuzzy memories. Together with that era&#x27;s activism, like the Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior. And fundraising as a kid for the Brazilian rain forest.
Further more, it seemed like a settled question: The future of energy is wind and solar! Of course it is. Renewables with no downsides, right? Wrong. Michael Shellenberger&#x27;s exposition of energy sou…</p>

            >HTML is general, ARIA is specific</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed 
 element should have, if any…
The proposed 
 element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a 
 or a  but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?
All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.
What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.
HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. 
? Sure, that can be a div. ? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. ? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a  and a  for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.
There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 98 beta was released on January 6, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in early February, 2022.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. Its usage in Chrome has declined
significantly over the last year. SDES is
removed because it is a
security problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that
entities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert
the Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

Today, we’re going to look at the different ways you can loop over things with vanilla JS, and when and why to choose one over the other.

            >The merit of hiring by merit</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve spent years pushing back against hiring practices based on years of irrelevance, pedigree gates, and brainteasers. These indirect measures of talent have proven both unreliable and unfair. If you can, why not look directly at merit?
When it comes to programmers, that merit is chiefly their ability to program! And program well. It&#x27;s not the only thing that matters, and being a good programmer isn&#x27;t alone sufficient to be hired at Basecamp, but it is a prerequisite. It doesn&#x27;t matter what else is true about you, if your programming chops aren&#x27;t up to par, there&#x27;s not going to be a job offer. 
So far, so uncontroversial, you&#x27;d think? But I&#x27;m increasingly seeing this basic lean on merit, as the key hiring assessment, becoming contested. Perhaps that started with the broad attempt to discr…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Each of us, in our own way, is in search of something greater, or just something that can give greater meaning to our lives. We are longing to become whole. Yet we’re far too busy looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying too much on distractions, stimulants, materialism, and every possible thing we can think of that we believe will give us the meaning we long for.   


Meanwhile, we all have thousands and thousands of thoughts that go through our minds daily, and we do very little to regulate its activity. But there is a way to reign in our busy internal dialogue and allow ourselves to experience life’s beauty and hidden meaning. What’s more, it’s available to each of us, free of charge.  


A Mindfulness practice, in which we pause the busy-ness of our minds, puts us into pre…</p>

Sandbox, tracking the milestones on
the path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more

timeline along with news from across
the project, but December was a quiet month. Instead, we&#x27;ll look back at some of
the activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make
now we are in the new year.

For a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the

Reassigning the variable Let’s say you have an array of wizards, like this.
let wizards &#x3D; [&#x27;Gandalf&#x27;, &#x27;Radagast&#x27;, &#x27;Merlin&#x27;];  You want to completely wipe it out. The most common way to do this is to reassign the value of the wizards variable to an empty array ([]).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.
Still, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.
In 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.
It all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public
websites as part of the
Private Network Access (PNA)
specification.
Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private
network request for a subresource, which asks
for explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will
carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the
response to it must carry a corresponding header,
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
targeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have
affected hundreds of thousands of users,
allowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite
gradient flavors.
In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an
evolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by
adding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse
for crisp and compact font files that compress well.
Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports
COLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.
# Color now
On the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does
not define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be
placed. That&#x27;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a
color. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that to…</p>

            >It&#x27;s not a lottery</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there&#x27;s already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I&#x27;m just left thinking: What&#x27;s the point? Do people think this is a lottery?
This isn&#x27;t unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don&#x27;t even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?
Maybe that&#x27;s part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don&#x27;t even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I&#x27;m skeptical.
Either way, it&#x27;s not how we review applications at Basecamp. There&#x27;s a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don&#x27;t comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a &quot;manager of managers&quot; for the director of engineering).
You might think, what&#x27;s the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that&#x27;s it. But I think there&#x27;s a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I&#x27;m not getting callbacks, so I&#x27;ll put even less effort into the next opening.
I guess what I&#x27;m saying is make the effort or don&#x27;t bother. We&#x27;re not drawing names out of a hat here.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We just opened a position for a Director of Engineering to help us manage our rapidly expanding technical teams at Basecamp. We already have more programmers on staff than we&#x27;ve ever had, and we intend to double that crew within the next 12-18 months. We&#x27;re going all-in on becoming a multi-product business again, and that means hiring the managers needed to to cope with those ambitions.
Not just because of this rapid growth on the technical teams, but because the rest of the company is growing along with it. We&#x27;ll be bigger than we&#x27;ve ever been this January, and before the end of the year, we&#x27;ll be much bigger still. Wild to think that after almost twenty years in business, we&#x27;re suddenly on a fast track to crack a hundred employees.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team&#x27;s work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what&#x27;s happening across the company.
The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it&#x27;s a book, it&#x27;s obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn&#x27;t like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let&#x27;s look at something that was posted internally, today.

By default, macOS uses Apple’s TextEdit app for any text file, and it’s pretty bad. Years ago, on my old machine, I setup Sublime to be my default editor for everything, but couldn’t remember how I did.
I eventually stumbled onto a thread on StackExchange with a working solution. I wanted to document it here so I wouldn’t forget again next time.</p>

            >Faith in eventually</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.

During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.

There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.

It’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.

This is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.

Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it&#x27;s never right even after.

In the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!

# Web Transport
If you&#x27;re using Web Sockets or the WebRTC Data Channel API to send messages
between your server and the page, there&#x27;s a new option for you. WebTransport
is a new API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.
It has lower latency than WebSockets, and unlike the RTC Data Channel API,
which is designed for peer-to-peer messaging, the Web Transport API is
specifically designed for client-se…</p>

 One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you don’t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.</p>

            >It could be worse</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I grew up with persistent reminders of how any bad thing that happened could easily have been worse. Oh, you scraped your knee? It could be worse, you could have broken your leg! Oh, you broke your leg? It could be worse, you could have cracked your skull! Oh, you cracked your skull? It could be worse, you could have died!
It wasn&#x27;t just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control. The way to make those setbacks and the inevitable suffering in life bearable was to constantly remind yourself that... it could be worse!
Any student of Stoicism will recognize this pattern of mental fortification. It&#x27;s closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality. And the ultimate resilience to face the struggles of living lies in controlling our reactions to the things that happen. Our reactions are not given. They can be changed.
I wish there was more of that today. More &quot;it could be worse&quot;. Less &quot;this is the worst thing ever&quot;.</p>

When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us.

One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or…</p>

Whenever someone writes and shares one of these year-end retrospectives the result is, by its very nature, personal. These last two years are different though. We all still have our own personal perspectives, but we also all share a collective experience of The Ongoing Situation.
Like, I can point to three pivotal events in 2021 and I bet you could point to the same three for you:
getting my first vaccine shot in March,
getting my second vaccine shot in June, and
getting my booster shot in December.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It was a very loud year, 2021. Which makes the satisfying silence of technical incidents at Basecamp all the more of a celebration. In the year that went, every single application we offer had at least 99.99% uptime! This is through repeated AWS outages, zero-day security alerts, and the drama of the world in those twelve months.
But it gets better. Basecamp 3 had an uptime of 99.997%. HEY pipped it by a point with 99.998% uptime. And Basecamp 2 hit the mythical five nines with 99.999% uptime! I believe that is the best reliability record we&#x27;ve ever achieved for a full year in our almost twenty year history as a software company. Worth a toast!
It&#x27;s the result of years of investments in things like active-active double data center deployments for our on-premise apps like Basecamp 2 and 3. …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">&quot;Winning&quot; – the word has a multitude of meanings. 


To some, it may mean to be at the top in every sense, ahead of everyone; and to some, it may mean chasing perfection.  


But what happens when you reach the “pinnacle” of Success? 


How do you stay a winner when you’re already at the top, and there’s nowhere else to go? How do you maintain that winning streak that syncs your flow through life? And most importantly how do you reap the possibilities created through ‘The Winning’?


“You and your organization, are most vulnerable when you are most successful.” – Robin Sharma, The Greatness Guide 


A real win is when you truly feel happy from within, and not vulnerable – Which can only happen when you can ‘Stop Worrying and Start Living.’

            >Books I read in 2021 [blog]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">As my year in reading goes, I&#x27;ve certainly read less books, but I&#x27;ve not spent less time reading. It&#x27;s just some books take me longer than others. For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it&#x27;s really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn&#x27;t count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site&#x27;s data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I&#x27;ve read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On the face of it, this seems like a basic medical question. One where reasonable people can weigh the same trade offs, yet arrive at different conclusions. And, as foreign as that might seem to Americans at the moment, that&#x27;s largely how this question has been tackled in Denmark in the public forum so far.
There are Danish pediatricians arguing that the determining factor should be that kids themselves don&#x27;t stand to benefit much from the vaccine. That the Danish principle on vaccines has up until this point weighed protecting the vaccinated themselves as the number one goal. And thus Denmark should not recommend the vaccine for kids broadly.
Then there are the health authorities saying that regardless of whether the vaccines are likely to help the individual kid, it&#x27;s important that they…</p>

Like Hidde, I prefer not to dwell too much on the negatives for these end-of-year posts. Suffice to say, in another pandemic year, there have been plenty of lows as well as highs.
CSS
There hasn’t been one single new CSS feature in 2021 that’s captured my attention above all others. But CSS continues to evolve and keep pace with developers’ needs. It’s great to see browsers coming through with widespread support for aspect-ratio. I’ve been using min(), max() and clamp() a lot more now that they’re widely supported, and finding them super convenient. And there are a lot of exciting new CSS features just over the horizon — some of which browsers are already beginning to implement. Her…</p>

The mantra for the year was “No goals, only vibes” and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.
Some highlights include:
🙁 Started the year in Stage 5 Covid
😃 Paid off our car!
🙁🙁🙁 Witnessed an insurrection
😢 Lost my grandma Joyce
😃 Started a ShopTalk Discord
😃😃😃 Got a new backyard office shed

😃 Spoke on Accessibility Backlogs at axe-con

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Phew. December. The most hectic month. End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.
But we made it.
The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained. This happens every year, to the extent that my wife’s family used…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta This was quite the year of change for Zen Habits, and everyone in the world. Chaos, growth, uncertainty, tragedy, joy, meaning. It’s hard to encapsulate it in words, because it contains multitudes and contradictions, but this has been such a year of powerful change. In this post, I’ll share what this year […]

Elsewhere in 2021 I published two seasons of the Clearleft podcast (12 episodes), and I wrote the 15 modules that comprise a course on responsive design on web.dev.
Most of my speaking engagements in 2021 were online though I did manage a little bit of travel in between COVID waves.
My travel map for the year includes one transatlantic trip: Christmas in Arizona, where I’m writing this end-of-year wrap-up before getting back on a plane to England tomorrow, Omicron willing.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I read 26 books in 2021, which is a bit more than I read in 2020. That said, some of them were brief books. I don’t think I actually read any more than my usual annual allotment of words.
I’m glad that I’m tracking my reading here on my own site. About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.
I continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.
Now that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…</p>

            >Does it make you enjoy?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My friend and I have been discussing cars.
He&#x27;s thinking of buying his first fancy one.
His dad had one years ago, and he&#x27;s thought about buying a car like this — like his dad&#x27;s — for years. He&#x27;s stressed over it, he&#x27;s agonized over it, and he&#x27;s spent a few too many hours thinking about all the reasons why and why not.
This morning he told me he was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make him happy.
Of course it won&#x27;t, I said. But that&#x27;s the wrong question.
The better question is &quot;Will I enjoy it?&quot;
Making you happy is too high a bar for anything. It&#x27;s unfair to ask that of anyone or anything — it&#x27;s something you can really only ask yourself, or bring yourself.
But enjoying something? That&#x27;s possible! It&#x27;s very much within reach.
So I said, will you enjoy the car? Could you see yourself enjoying the car? Will you enjoy the drive?
And that&#x27;s a much easier question to answer. And an expectation that&#x27;s easier to accept.
Objects (and experiences) don&#x27;t make you anything, you have to enjoy them.
Enjoying something is plenty.
I think he&#x27;s going to buy one.</p>

            >A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Monk &amp; Robot, #1) [book]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn&#x27;t the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of &quot;millennium type problems&quot;. Using air quotes in my description because I&#x27;m fairly sure this is a patronising statement I&#x27;m making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they&#x27;re left feeling empty. Obviously it&#x27;s an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I&#x27;ve already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex&#x27;s personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, so Chamber&#x27;s settles with using the &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with &quot;it&quot; and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is &quot;they&quot;. This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn&#x27;t happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber&#x27;s wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won&#x27;t cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.</p>

What makes you think that? It&#x27;s possible that your circumstances and mindset were holding you back.


In fact, our mindset accounts for 80% of our success and mechanics and circumstances account for 20%. Most people know enough to get the job done, but they don&#x27;t because their psychology is out of sync with their objectives.


You can&#x27;t guarantee success, but you can improve your chances. After all, chance favors the prepared. Here I am sharing 6 ways to increase the odds of success.

            >Ask HN: Is there a proper design pattern for this situation?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software&#x27;s API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.
I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I&#x27;m certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I&#x27;d like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.
The problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don&#x27;t see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.
In a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that&#x27;s not an option.
Is my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?

But the calculation for converting sRGB colors to HSL colors sets the hue value to NaN [1]. Why? If I can&#x27;t trust the standard to be correct, then what can I trust?

            >:has() Has Landed in Safari</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:
section:has(img) {
  background: lightgray;
}
But eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.
You could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:
form:has(input:invalid) {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
The parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.
It’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():
@supports selector(:has(*)) {
  .info,
  .warning {
    display: none;
  }
}
On a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.</p>

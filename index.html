            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi, I&#x27;m a PM at a series B startup. I&#x27;ve been put in charge of redesigning the web page, which currently sucks. Ideally, I can outsource most of this to a good web dev agency. We are in the MLOps space, and so some domain knowledge from the agency would be great (or the ablity to learn about the space and incorporate it into the design). Does anyone have any good recs for an agency like this?

On iOS devices, Apple bans the use of alternative browser engines – this means that Apple has a monopoly over the supply of browser engines on iOS. It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine. This restriction has 2 main effects:
limiting rival browsers’ ability to differentiate themselves from Safari on factors such as speed and functionality, meaning that Safari faces less competition from other browsers than it otherwise could do; and

In this whole saga, I must admit to a guilty pleasure of chuckling at all the folks infuriated by the fact that Rogan commands such popularity from his off-the-cuff approach. Here&#x27;s his own presentation of his style:

These podcasts are very strange because they’re just conversations. And oftentimes I have no idea what I’m going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people. And that’s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I’m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and they’re just conversations, and I think that’s also the appeal of the show. It’s one of the things tha…</p>

            >Work unites what politics divide</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It&#x27;s quite literally a creative force.
When you&#x27;re focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.
This is the wisdom of the Mark Twain&#x27;s etiquette &quot;never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company&quot;. Specifically the point about &quot;polite company&quot;. It&#x27;s the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.
All this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People&#x27;s religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. 
Today social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people&#x27;s stances on the thorniest issues. It&#x27;s often hard not to know someone&#x27;s leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.
But it&#x27;s worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That&#x27;s the choice of the creative force.</p>

As you gain experience as an engineer, you start to realize that some traditional coding structure is a good thing, even if it slows you down. Using Jest or […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># The permissions UX until now
When a user visits a site that requests a permission, a bubble pops up to prompt the user to make a
decision. For example, below you can see the geolocation permission prompt as implemented in Chrome
up to version 96. (You can try this and other permissions on our demo site
permission.site.)
# Most permission prompts are ignored or dismissed
Chrome&#x27;s telemetry data proves that a lot of permission prompts are ignored. You can explore the
notification permission data
in the Chrome UX report yourself. For now, consider the table below that shows
how Windows users reacted to the geolocation and the notification prompts on sites in an accumulated way:

Percent of geolocation prompts

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Episode 28: by Mark Cogan in Paris, France (January, 2022)
Previous episodes
In 2022, Chrome on iOS will celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Chrome is one of the most widely used iOS apps—it&#x27;s currently the number 2 Utility app in the US App Store.
Chrome on iOS provides all of the great Chrome features our users love, including Sync, Translate, Incognito, Password Manager, Autofill, and many more.
Chrome on iOS also integrates with native iOS features such as multi-window and device-wide password autofill.
However, there&#x27;s one major thing that makes Chrome on iOS very different from all other Chrome platform implementations.
Chrome on iOS doesn&#x27;t use Blink.
Because of Apple&#x27;s App Store rules, Chrome on iOS has to use the iOS platform APIs for fetching and rendering web content. So Chrome on i…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
If you’ve tried the Auto Dark Theme origin trial, there’s a new way to
opt out at a per element level.
There’s now support for COLRv1, an evolution of the COLRv0 font
format.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 98.
# Opting out of auto-dark themes on Android
In Chrome 96, we started an origin trial for
Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, if your site is light themed and the user’s OS is in dark
mode, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to your site.
If you&#x27;ve signed up for the origin trial, and you want to opt out of the
automatically generated dark theme for a specific page, you can use a meta tag.

Or you can opt-ou…</p>

            >Cascade layers are coming to your browser</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Cascade layers (the @layer CSS rule) are coming to Chromium 99, Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4 Beta. They enable more explicit control of your CSS files to prevent style-specificity conflicts. This is particularly useful for large codebases, design systems, and when managing third party styles in applications.
Layering your CSS in a clear way prevents unexpected style overrides and promotes better CSS architecture.
# CSS specificity and the cascade
CSS specificity is how CSS decides which styles to apply to which elements. The different selectors you can use  determine the specificity of any style rule. For example, elements are less specific than classes or attributes, which are in turn less specific than IDs. This is an elemental part of learning CSS.
Folks turn to CSS naming conventions li…</p>

 Things can fail if JS is unsupported if they’re “nice to have” features. Anything critical needs to work without JavaScript.
 In response, reader Caleb Stauffer asked how I would handle a flyout or drawer nav menu (“think mobile with a hamburger icon” - shared with permission).

To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main &quot;erpnext&quot; account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!
I am a pretty proficient user and I wasn&#x27;t drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.
My feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than &quot;Feedback&quot;. To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.
If any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
It is January February already, and it feels like time flies. In the world of technology, there are always so many news, trends, and possible distractions. On top of that, we already have so much work to do, projects to finish, and people to please. It is easy to feel empty or get burned out. Plus, we still live in the middle of an uncomfortable situation for everyone, a so far unseen pandemic situation; This causes a lot of mental problems on its own and drains a lot of energy from us.
What we can do in this case — although it’s hard to accept — is slowing down.
When I feel overwhelmed, I try to go outside as much as possible. I will get some fresh air, have a long walk and reflect on the things I do. I try to answer the question: »What brings me joy in web development?«. After that,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey!
Back again with another installment of Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something. So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
While this is a video, it&#x27;s really about sound. If you like cars, or simply dig physics, I bet you&#x27;ll find this video (and audio) fascinating. I sure did. Why do engines sound they way they do? I was surprised by what I heard. 
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ygGmLbzuBU4
Read Something
While this is an article, it&#x27;s the little looping video that blew my mind. Scientists at the University of Vermont, Tufts University and Harvard University&#x27;s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering said they have discovered an entirely new form of biological reproduction different from any animal or plant known to science. Absolutely fascinating. 
Read it: https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/americas/xenobots-self-replicating-robots-scn/index.html
Saw Something
This brief video on Dutch street design and safety hones in specifically on the concept of continuous sidewalks. I remember noticing this when we spent time in Amsterdam a few years back, and it struck me as absolutely obvious, yet completely foreign to my eyes. BTW, I can&#x27;t wait to get back to Amsterdam — love that place. 
See it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9OfBpQgLXUc
Until next time.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.
It’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handfu…</p>

This is the bedrock of science.
Rarely has this principle been proven more emphatically true than over the past few years. Our truth, their truth, your truth has been sent fumbling in the dark. Trying its way through the maze of reality, finding dead ends at every turn.

            >Why Confidence Is Silent And Insecurities Loud – The Honest Truth</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Confidence is silent and insecurities are loud. This is a common quote in the world of self-development. This quote is very true and understanding it is crucial. Yet, not everybody understands it.


If you understand it, you&#x27;ll achieve a greater level of confidence that benefits you in many ways. You&#x27;ll gain more happiness, higher self-esteem, and more opportunities. Fail to understand it, and the consequences can be nasty.


Today, I&#x27;d like to break down this topic for you. If you want to know how to implement this mindset and why it’s like this, read on.


Determining confidence


In an informal language, confidence often means trusting in your abilities. If someone speaks poorly about you, can you maintain a positive opinion about you? When you&#x27;re seizing an opportunity, can deal with t…</p>

Like many people, I’ve been reading a lot about the world of crypto and NFTs and trying to get my head around it. I’ve avoided professing a strong opinion publicly, as I honestly don’t feel knowledgable enough. But it’s safe to say, I’m an NFT skeptic.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of digital artists getting paid for their work — just not at any cost. And the horrendous environmental impact of the Ethereum platform is a far too high a cost in my opinion. I should add, Ethereum claims to be committed to moving to proof-of-stake, which will vastly reduce its energy consumption. It’s not there yet, but there are “Clean NF…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I situated myself in the premium white leather chair, lowered the rollercoaster-like safety harness over my torso, and carefully weighed options on the console in front of me.
&gt; Evening . . . . . . . . 20/person
&gt; Overnight . . . . . . . 100/person
&gt; Weekend . . . . . . . . 250/person
&gt; Week (BEST VALUE!)  . . 5000/family (Limit: 5)

I looked over my right shoulder to see my wife and kids’ anxious faces gleaming back at me, ready with the nervous energy of a thousand suns to embark on our well-earned vacation. It’s been awhile. Some rough, lean years working like hell but through sacrifices and extreme budgeting we had finally saved up enough.
I hesitated to tap the screen. A nervous laugh. A moment of internal calculus. Maybe a handful of evenings would be enough. Would it have the same effect? A couple weekends would surely be enough to reset. More economical. And then we’d have a little left over, just in case.
I sensed my wife’s mind-reading. I sensed her fear I would succumb to my inner self-doubt. She has been working the hardest for this. Sacrificing to create these memories. I needed to shake those miser habits we’ve formed out of years of austerity, what has become my identity.
“Oh, alright. Here we go,” I groaned and grimaced as I tapped the screen.
“You selected One Week” chimed the female voice of the console. Our chairs tilted slightly back, I felt the credits debit from my account, we were off. Finally.
The hiss of the pneumatic syringes, the sting on the spinal column, the cool and heavy breeze of the sedatives, the warm cocktail of endorphins and dopamine to stimulate our deepest dreams and desires, the chairs and harnesses catching our weight as we drifted away from consciousness. The lights in the room slowly dimmed. We would be back in a week.</p>

Whilst Julie also raised over £650 which pays for the creation.

# Background
A frequent request we hear from web developers is:
Current answers are not great; they rely on external libraries, CSS hacks, or
specific browser behaviors like simulating a user interaction with click().
I&#x27;m happy to share that those days will be over soon as the web platform is
introducing a canonical way to show a browser picker for  elements with
these types: &quot;date&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;datetime-local&quot;,

Today, let’s talk about it!
First, a quick aside on 4g versus 3g Alan’s article notes:
 When using lab tools such as Lighthouse, the network is tethered to simulate 3G, but mobile networks worldwide have changed recently. According to a May 2020 report by Opensignal, the worldwide average availability for 4G is 86.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">With 2021 the worst year for worker productivity, it has to be asked: is this largely because work-from-home isn&#x27;t working out?
We can find lots of excuses (resignations; worker malaise; economic decline) but isn&#x27;t most of that laid right back at the door of work-from-home?
When just a few are involved it may be viable. But I&#x27;m beginning to think, it will never fly to have almost everybody staying home. Something critical about the work environment gets broken, when nobody is minding the shop.

            >Spotify must be afraid of canceling Rogan, right? Right?!</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">What&#x27;s stood out most to me about the latest Rogan round over Neil Young&#x27;s ultimatum is the iron-clad assumption that Spotify surely must – MUST! – agree with the underlying premise. That Rogan is a menace to society because he host guests with divergent views on covid, and because he shares his unsanctioned opinion on the matter. Therefore, the only reason they&#x27;re not yanking him is fear. Fear of losing subscribers, money, marketshare, whatever. It can&#x27;t possibly be due to a genuine disagreement with the menace-to-society charge.
Jonathan Haidt talks about this in The Righteous Mind:

            >We can&#x27;t thrive without friction</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Social media platforms have been on relentless quest since their inception to remove all friction from all acts of engagement. The distance from emotion to reaction has been whittled away one A/B test at the time, and there&#x27;s barely any left. You don&#x27;t even have to portray any original sentiment today, just like or retweet that of someone else, and you&#x27;ll be microdosing on that sweet rush of belonging.
We know it too! Celebrate it, even! Have you seen that new thing that just went viral? SAVAGE. Yes, this level of virulent spread is savage. Because it&#x27;s literally been engineered in a lab to be so. All our natural human defenses have been studied by machines learning, and are now effectively and consistently evaded. No wonder this meta virus has taken over key parts of society.

            >No big deal or the end of the world?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here’s something that should be obvious: People don’t like to have their grievances downplayed or dismissed. When that happens, even the smallest irritations can turn into an obsessive crusade.
Imagine you’re staying at a hotel, and the air conditioning isn’t working right. You call the front desk to mention it, and they say, oh yeah, they know about that, and someone is going to come fix that next week (after you’ve left). In the meantime, could you just open a window (down to that noisy, busy street)? Not a word of apology, no tone of contrition.
Now what was a mild annoyance – that it’s 74F degrees when you like to sleep at 69F – is suddenly the end of the world! You swell with righteous fury, swear you’ll write a letter to management, and savage the hotel in your online review.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today we’re super excited to pull back the curtains and unveil a new UI for WebPageTest—one we’ve been working on for a while now and that we think will make it a lot easier to use for WebPageTest power users as well as folks who are just getting started in their performance journey.

WebPageTest is definitely a power tool, and it was important to us that we didn’t lose the depth and accuracy of the data that we surface. So if you’ve been using WebPageTest for a while, don’t worry—everything is still there.
But being a powerful tool doesn’t mean we want to exclude folks who may not be familiar with WebPageTest, or may be newer to performance. Quite the opposite, in fact. We want to make it easier for everyone to be able to see how their sites perform and figure out what they can do to make…</p>

# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a Privacy Sandbox proposal to serve
remarketing and custom audience use cases, designed so that it cannot be used by
third parties to track user browsing behavior across sites. The API enables on-device auctions by
the browser, to choose relevant ads for websites the user has previously visited.
FLEDGE is the first experiment to be implemented in Chromium within the
TURTLEDOVE family of proposals.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">That “starts in 5 seconds” thing, and that having to confirm that you’re still there thing - they can be annoying at times.
What about removing those two features, and implementing one new feature that achieves the same on your end, but which minimises the annoyance on our end, namely:
“Starts in 2 minutes” and “Press to skip”.
And I invite all UX-passionate HNers who think this is a terrible idea to please elucidate us.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A short three years ago, I wrote about The Crushing Weight of the Facepile: how the image weight of the webmention avatar images were proving to be prohibitvely large.
At that time, I decided the best solution was to lazy load all of the Webmention Avatars. I used IntersectionObserver to do this because loading&#x3D;&quot;lazy&quot; wasn’t supported anywhere. It still isn’t on Safari 😬. I went further and threw the Webmention Likes into a closed  element so they wouldn’t load until the collapsible was expanded.
Historically, I would have solved this problem by processing and optimizing these images at build-time. But at this scale of image count, the build-time costs seemed prohibitive! I don’t think this is a priority to be fixed upstream, either.
But I finally have a new method. A better meth…</p>

Twitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.
I mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click &gt; Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.
Ok. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do befor…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I want to switch away from regular business software development to a chip or hardware company (HP, Intel, AMD are all nearby). I&#x27;m self-taught as a dev, but I&#x27;m considering a degree that would open doors to these types of positions. The degree I&#x27;m considering is Computer Engineering, which is advertised as being a middle layer between EE and CS degrees. I wanted to know if self-teaching is an option before I take on the student loan debt.
Are academic credentials/internships required for these kinds of jobs?

            >Ask HN: Why does productivity and health feel diametrically opposed?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I usually find myself swinging between 2 moods; One is being productive, writing, shipping code, features, working on side projects...
At that time, I&#x27;ll be also drinking, eating junk, tons of coffee, irregular sleep, staying inside for days, etc...
Then when I see that it is not very healthy, I will go to the gym, be regular, eat better and socialize. That leaves little to no energy to do more than minimum work.
It seems that I can&#x27;t merge the good parts of each cycle and be  social, healthy, while at the same time, productive and motivated.
Has anyone here been in this situation and figured their way out?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Next week, virtually all pandemic restrictions will be gone from Danish society. No mask mandates, no vaccine passports, no distancing, no limitations on bars, restaurants, or night clubs. This follows a determination by the government&#x27;s pandemic council that the virus is no longer threat to the functioning of society, and thus no longer warrants broad, societal restrictions.
What&#x27;s striking about this decision is that it&#x27;s been taken against a backdrop of all-time record infection rates. In Copenhagen, the incident rate per 100,000 was 4,735 over the past seven days! The national positivity rate on the almost quarter of a million PCR tests performed every day is now 23%! The number of hospitalizations with covid is hovering at pandemic highs.
But the number of patients in the ICU because …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I was leaving a doctor’s appointment and as I rounded the corner to the waiting room I could hear the dulcet tones of a ukulele, but it sounded close.
My first reaction was “What in the fuck is going on?” as I scanned the ceiling for the speaker where the Muzak was coming from. Then in the waiting room I saw an older white man with a ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt calmly strumming his ukulele.
Again, I reacted, “What the fuck is going on?”
Then I caught myself. This… is… weird.
Why was he playing it in the doctors office? Was he a minstrel? Was he calming the souls of fellow patients?  A minister? A minister to himself? Does he just love Hawaii and goddamn it ain’t no one gonna stop him not even the cops at the doctors office?
I think this moment struck me like a ton of bricks because it’s been awhile since I’ve encountered weird due to the pandemic. Angry? Oh, I’ve encountered plenty of angry. Hot-headed assholes losing their shit in a Chic-fil-A drive thru, yeah I’ve seen that, but been awhile since I’ve seen weird.
The world could use a little more weird.

Let’s dig in!
The parseInt() method You can use the parseInt() method to convert a string into an integer (a whole number). The second argument, 10, is called the radix. This is the base number used in mathematical systems. For our use, it should always be 10.</p>

Essentially you upload a design from something like figma, and then the output is the react markup.

As a CS student who has trouble staying focused while working, I made a Chrome extension that gamifies productivity by the minute, using a Pomodoro-like timer.
- Earn a mint for every minute worked (and block sites like Facebook, Youtube, and/or Hacker News(?) while working)
- Earn mints for completing todos from a personal todo list
- Spend mints on rewards like watching TV or treating yourself to dining out
I hope this can help others stay productive and would love feedback!

            >Just the cost of doing business [crimes]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Dutch competition authorities just slapped Apple with a five million euro fine for refusing to comply with the country&#x27;s new requirements on App Store policies. These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business [crimes]!
The five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball points out, €50 million is &quot;spare-change-under-the-sofa&quot; money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue.
This is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there&#x27;s a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law.
I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don&#x27;t apply when you&#x27;re dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a €50 million fine is chump change.
What&#x27;ll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there&#x27;s just no way this is the last stop. If Apple willfully decides to flip off the Dutch and their national sovereignty, I think we might just see the leviathan that is the European Union awaken.</p>

The vast majority of the time, it just doesn’t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work.

This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from “I have to call Jeff into a meeting now to get his take on this new feature idea” to “I’ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live later, if needed”.

A few years ago, I realized that helping others have that “aha” moment, seeing them build cool stuff, sharing that excitement at landing their first developer job… that’s way more exciting to me than doing client work.
So now, I get to focus all of my energy on doing more of that! 🤗

Mental health is a common problem for many individuals, globally. Most people have no idea that they have mental health issues but move on everyday just like a typical day. These issues arise from workplaces, homes, or interactions with people or activities that stress your mind. According to a study, poor mental health causes about 14 percent of all deaths worldwide and increases the mortality rate by 2.2 percent compared to individuals doing well mentally. Thirty percent of all grownups experience mental health issues at some point in their lives, with the large number among this set comprising low-income earners. Poor control of your mental health can lead to suicidal thoughts, which by itself claims 800,000 deaths a year globally. From these statistics, you can t…</p>

I did what any curious but self-doubting person might do in this situation. I posted a Twitter poll. The results surprised me!
But before we go much further, let’s go over the problems we’re trying to solve:
Performance: when you leave off a trailing slash and the platform expects one (or vice versa), you get a redirect which is a performance no-no.
SEO: if your content exists at two (or more!) distinct URL endpoints, it is a SEO no-no. SE-no-no. SEO-apolo-graphql-anton-ohno (I apologize for nothing). *Ahem*. You need redirects.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Geniunly curious and not competent to answer this myself.
I am a hobbyist. I don&#x27;t intend to take a career in front-end (maybe in a decade) and just hacking away on my own small projects using external APIs. It is probably for another post but after being scared of coding for such a long time, it seems so interesting and kind of a new world (despite the frustrations obviously).
The thing is, I came quite late to it and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS whilst finally delving into React which has been... welll confusing. It generally feels like an overkill and learning new things about it not enjoyable anymore as a beginner.
I have delved into Svelte in the past week and it just has been a completely different story. I am not associated with them, and I am not trying to promote it as I want to just ask whether React felt as frustrating as for me or am I missing something?

            >Tell HN: I created a complex DB design as an experiment</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I am working on a side-project to learn web-development. The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of &quot;content&quot;(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging. So during the development I thought what if I treat everything in the app as &quot;content&quot; and create hierarchy of the content, and then create every entity relation in the DB as many-to-many. Naturally, lot of tables were created in the DB. But that got me thinking, that this design opens up lots of interesting use-cases such as sub-accounts, group accounts, sub-posts, multi-commenting, multi-reporting, comment-threading, group-posting etc.
This was a very interesting exercise. I think there will be DB performance as well as storage size issues with this design. Not sure though, never tried anything like this in practice.

Let’s dig in!
The String.padStart() method The String.padStart() method adds characters to the beginning of a string if it’s less than a certain length. This is particularly useful for numbers that need leading 0’s (but can do so much more than that).
The String.padStart() method accepts two arguments: the length the string should be, and what characters to add if it’s not that length.</p>

The code is covered by license, but are design decisions? Especially given the fact, that they were openly discussed before the code was written?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi there HN.
Aamu.app is an app that I&#x27;ve made and I hope to get some feedback.
It aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.
Why did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I&#x27;m talking about things like Microsoft&#x27;s offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.
I realize it&#x27;s quite a big app for one person to do, but let&#x27;s just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn&#x27;t stop after I had started it.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’d love to read through a book on React, but I’m surprised at the poor reviews on Amazon. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place. Who can point me to a good one (that maybe isn’t sold from Amazon)?
Alternatively, why should I not be considering React? Is everybody using something else these days? Looking to build a front-end to interact with some REST APIs.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Mac is such an inconvenient platform for Apple. It prevents the company from making any credible claim of an impending security catastrophe, if lawmakers force the iPhone to allow installation of apps without the App Store. With the Mac, we have almost forty years of proof that computers don&#x27;t need an App Store to be safe. Made by the same company that now tries to pretend to legislators that this isn&#x27;t possible!
Worse still, Apple continues to brag about this solid security record for the Mac when they try to sell you a new computer while their lobbyists argue the opposite on Capitol Hill. Here&#x27;s how the company presents the Mac as a fortress when it comes to apps installed without the Mac App Store:

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Saw a fascinating idea in a tweet from @simevidas to show favicons on external links on a site. Full credit for the original idea to Kiko Beats.
The implementation used an icon font to store the favicons. I think we can improve on this idea (do y’all want to maintain an icon font 😅) to save some future maintenance using IndieWeb Avatar. This will allow the images to auto-update when a site updates their favicon (per server caching rules).
Add this CSS to see it in action:
a[href*&#x3D;&quot;twitter.com&quot;]:before {
  content: &quot;&quot;;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: text-bottom;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  margin: 0 .2em;
  background-size: contain;
  background-image: url(&quot;https://v1.indieweb-avatar.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2F/&quot;);

            >Screenshots</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I wrote about how I created a page on The Session with instructions for installing the site to your home screen. When I said that I included screenshots on that page, I may have underplayed the effort involved. It was real faff.
I’ve got an iPhone so generating screenshots (and video) from that wasn’t too bad. But I don’t have access to an Android phone. I found myself scouring the web for templates that I could use to mockup a screenshot of the address bar.
That got me thinking…
Wouldn’t it be cool if there were a service that generated those screenshots for you? You give it a URL, and it spits out screenshots of the site complete with overlays showing the installation flow on Android and iOS. It could even generate the img markup, complete with differently-scaled images for the srcset attribute.
Download the images. Copy that markup. Paste it into a page on your site. Boom! Now you’ve got somewhere to point your visitors to if you’d like them to install your progressive web app.
There are already some services out there for generating screenshots of mobile phones but they’re missing is the menu overlays for adding to home screen.
The devrels at both Google and Microsoft have been doing a great job of promoting progressive web apps. They’ve built tools to help you with tasks like generating icons or creating your web app manifest. It would be sooooo nifty if those tools also generated instructional screenshots for adding to home screen!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In JavaScript, event listeners have to be attached to individual elements. You can’t attach them to an array or node list of matching elements like you might in jQuery.
Today, we’re going to look at a technique that you can use listen for the same even on multiple elements without having to attach to each element individually: event delegation.
Let’s dig in!
The EventTarget.addEventListener() method As a quick primer, you can use the EventTarget.</p>

            >Ask HN: Are System Design documents out of fashion?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’ve been hopping around a number of large non-FAANG enterprises for the past few years. In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design / Architecture documentation.
I struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals/antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)
Digging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.
Cloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf/Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.
In the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ/Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.
All of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.
So HN:
Do you teams document these architectural designs?
Have I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?
How do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt / Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?
Appreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.

            >Ask HN: Existing framework to build/control a UI from a workflow?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Before I build something myself, I wanted to check if there is anything already out there that does this.
Essentially want to build custom apps by designing them in a visual workflow builder to define the interactivity.
Imagine being able to drag a &quot;Prompt&quot; activity, define the content you want to display to the user, and the options for how the user can respond (ex: show Yes/No buttons, or other choices), and then have a decision activity that can evaluate what the user chose and branch to some other UI - like another prompt dialog, or a file upload dialog, or a form, etc etc.
The more activities that you implement the richer the app you could build.
Right now I am leaning towards using &quot;node red&quot; as the workflow engine, and building a bunch of custom nodes that represent all the UI functionality I want - and then implementing an app host in Angular or React that will integrate with the workflow - probably via web socket messages.
So at the end of the day, this App Host UI is receiving commands from the workflow as far as what content to display to the user, and then sending back what the user is doing with the UI to the workflow so it can send follow up commands.

            >Free is never forever</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Google gave away free email on custom domains for years. This unsurprisingly lured lots of people into switching to Gmail. But now the party is over, and what used to be free will now easily cost $500/year or more (if you have 10 users on a custom domain). Yikes.
Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;m not actually against Google charging for email. The long deep freeze of innovation in email came as a result of Google giving away free* service. (* It wasn&#x27;t ever free FREE, of course, but the price in data and attention wasn&#x27;t obvious to most before they got hooked.)
The problem is the switcheroo. When you give something away for free for years, and then suddenly show up with a demand for payment, people are rightfully going to feel like it&#x27;s a stickup. Especially if they have over a decade&#x27;s worth of data that&#x27;s difficult to get out locked inside that box you gave them for &quot;free&quot;.
It feels even more so if the vendor showing up with demands for payment is a monopolist like Google. Who controls the majority of all email that flows in the US. Then it very much feels like you got suckered. Oh, we were just the stepping stone for you to get the dominant marketshare, and now that you&#x27;ve captured it, you return for the loot? Gah.
Email wasn&#x27;t ever free to offer. Especially not the unlimited kind with gigabytes of storage that gave Gmail its original splash. It&#x27;s just that Google monetized it through data plunder (like reading your purchase receipts!), attention drains (promoted emails!), and now finally with a paid switcheroo for the most locked-in accounts.
You could of course also just pay with cash monies from the get go. And vote with those dollars for what you&#x27;d like to see more of in the world. How&#x27;s that for a New Year&#x27;s resolution: Paying for things with money, and skipping the ones that aren&#x27;t worth it.</p>

            >Apple turns the legislative contempt up to 11</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In North Dakota, Apple sent Erik Neuenschwander, a chief privacy engineer, to make its case that opening up the App Store to free and fair competition on payment processing would be bad for privacy. He focused in a relatively sober tone on the sanctity of Apple&#x27;s integration and curation as arguments for why they deserved their monopoly privileges. A technical witness perhaps stretching the truth to fit the narrative needed, but at least feeling somewhat constrained by it.
In Arizona, Apple sent Kyle Andeer, the Chief Compliance Offer, to claim that preventing Apple from shaking down app developers for 30% would be tantamount to &quot;a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store&quot; because it would &quot;allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free&quot;.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Pessimism can spark an idea.
Annoyance can drive ingenuity.
Disappointment can redirect effort towards change.
But creativity requires optimism.
Creativity isn&#x27;t about starting something. It&#x27;s about making something. Making requires sustained effort, and sustained effort requires fuel.
That fuel is optimism.
When you run out, momentum dies, and effort grinds to a halt.
When you run out, creativity converts to drudgery.
When you run out, you give up.
If you&#x27;re making something that doesn&#x27;t exist, you must believe that it can. That&#x27;s optimism, that&#x27;s the feeling. That&#x27;s the chemical reaction. Without it, creativity is inert.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I don’t know about you, but it seems like everyone I follow on Twitter is playing Wordle. Although I don’t play the game myself, I think it’s pretty great.
Not only does Wordle have a very sweet backstory, but it’s also unashamedly on the web. If you want to play, you go to the URL powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle. That’s it. No need to download an app.
That hasn’t stopped some nefarious developers trying to trick people into downloading their clones of Wordle from app stores. App stores, which are meant to be curated and safe, are in fact filled with dodgy knock-offs and scams. Contrary to popular belief, the web is quite literally a safer bet.
Wordle has a web app manifest, which means you can add it to your home screen and it will behave just like a native app (although I don’t believe it has…</p>

Let’s dig in!
A quick note on case Vanilla JavaScript uses camelCased versions of the properties you would use in CSS.
For example, background-image in CSS is backgroundImage in JavaScript. The font-weight property in CSS is fontWeight in JavaScript.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Context: I am a full stack developer that uses React to build simple UIs for technical simulations.
When working with React I spent a lot of time, also out of curiousity, on different solutions for certain problems (Think of Redux, MobX, and Recoil or React wrappers like React-Konva).
With Svelte I don&#x27;t do that. It seems most basic functionality is included in a thin layer of abstract above HTML, CSS, and JS (ref. The truth about Svelte by Rich Harris) and the Svelte standard library. From state management, reactivity, and with SvelteKit, to SSR and code splitting. For problems not covered is was, until now, always easy to use TS/JS.
Question: is Svelte lean and pragmatic or is it missing something?
Note: I know React, use it, and like it (especially with hooks &amp; Redux-Toolkit).
As I am far from senior, maybe there are some complexities I am not seeing yet.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few days ago, an anonymous Twitter user claiming to be an employee at a Big Tech company wrote a thread about work that went viral (since deleted, possibly partly by Twitter). Hazard Harrington&#x27;s thread depicted a company drowning in woke excesses, so of course it sent the internet to the trenches. &quot;This is EXACTLY what we suspected!!&quot; firing at &quot;There&#x27;s NO WAY this is true, total fanfic!!&quot; and back again.
There&#x27;s of course no way of knowing either way based on what was presented. This is an anonymous account of an unnamed company detailing personal but unverifiable experiences. (Not unlike a myriad of threads claiming to expose various isms in a similar anonymous, unverifiable format!)
It certainly could be true! The comments were full of folks backing up the account from their experien…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just discovered that I really like watching people code, and it&#x27;s a great source of learning for me just through observation.
My main requirements:
- Not a &quot;tutorial&quot;. I don&#x27;t want someone who has already scripted and prepared all the steps for the video. Looking for something more improvisational, of course, ideally they should be experienced or produce high quality code and at least partially explain their thought process as they&#x27;re doing it.
- Preferably web dev focused - I&#x27;ve been trying to hone my skills with HTML / CSS / JS / TS and React mainly, but really open to anything if I think I can learn some good coding practices from it.
An example of a recent one I liked was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;K77xThbu66A
However, I would prefer something a little less hacky than this if possible. Still was a decent view to follow along.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Mondrian is famous for paintings with big thick black lines forming a grid, where each cell is white, red, yellow, or blue. This aesthetic pairs well with the notoriously rectangular web, and that hasn’t gone unnoticed over the years with …

Whether polling on the client or server sides, being reactive to specific conditions helps to improve user experience. One task I recently needed to complete required that my setInterval immediately execute and then continue executing. The conventional and best way to immediately call […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Yesterday, one of my students asked me how I record my JavaScript video courses and workshop lessons.
Today, I wanted to share both my technical setup and general approach to making videos. Let’s dig in!
Screen recording I use Screenflow for screen recording.
It’s macOS only. If you’re feeling cheap, you can also just use QuickTime, but I found that makes my fans spin like crazy. Screenflow also has some great editing features, including easy cropping and zooming, noise isolation, and so on.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This issue was raised here many times: RSS is convinient and versatile. It&#x27;s mostly gone due to lack of authentication and monetization paths (ads/premium content for sign ups)
This lack of features led us back to email newsletters with businesses like Substack shining in it.
Yet, email is restrictive, unorganized, and its html support is cryptic at best. It also in the control of the sender (push) unlike RSS that is under the control of the receiver (pull).
Do we have an RSS alternative that adds authentication and other features to allow for the decentralization of email, with modern features enabled by smart RSS readers?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Matt Taibbi wrote a great piece called The Left is Now the Right last year. It detailed how many of the tactics and thought processes anyone who came of age in the 90s would recognize as &quot;of the right&quot; are now being used by the opposite side of the political spectrum. A clip:

Conservatives once tried to legislate what went on in your bedroom; now it’s the left that obsesses over sexual codicils, not just for the bedroom but everywhere. Right-wingers from time to time made headlines campaigning against everything from The Last Temptation of Christ to “Fuck the Police,” though we laughed at the idea that Ice Cube made cops literally unsafe, and it was understood an artist had to do something fairly ambitious, like piss on a crucifix in public, to get conservative protesters off their couche…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The advent of import maps, and the bundler-less JavaScript reality it introduced, was undoubtedly my favorite advancement in web tech for 2021. Between Guy Bedford&#x27;s excellent shim and native support in Chrome 89, we&#x27;ve finally been granted an escape from a decade&#x27;s worth of frustrating complexity with excess tooling.
Usually progress means more to learn, more to master. It&#x27;s not often we get to celebrate the progress of true conceptual compression, so when we do, the confetti is well deserved. Hurrah for import maps!
Thus I&#x27;m thrilled to announce that HEY has been running on import maps in production for the past two weeks, and the experience has been bliss. An entire class of problems flushed from the daily development experience. WOOSH.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta So many of us feel a scarcity of time: we feel rushed, like there’s not enough time to do everything, always behind, never feeling like we’re doing enough. This problem is called “time scarcity,” and it’s one of the most common stresses in our society. So how do we deal with this? […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When the web.dev team at Google contacted Clearleft about writing a course on responsive design, our eyes lit up.
This was clearly a good fit. For one thing, Clearleft has been pioneering responsive design from day one—we helped launch some of the first responsive sites in the UK. But there was another reason why this partnership sounded good: we had the same approach to writing and sharing.
Ever since Clearleft was founded in 2005 we’ve taken on board the motto of the World Wide Web itself: let’s share what we know. As well as doing the work, we enjoy sharing how the work gets done. Whether it’s case studies, blog posts, podcasts, or conference talks, we’re always thinking about ways to contribute to the web community.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I finally had a chance to read ILSR&#x27;s blockbuster report on Amazon&#x27;s squeeze of independent retailers who sell through their marketplace. It&#x27;s unusually well-written and researched, and the picture it paints is depressingly familiar to anyone who&#x27;ve been at the sharp end of a big tech monopoly spear.
The overarching conclusion is that the squeeze is accelerating, and that the average all-in cut Amazon extracts from independent retailers on their marketplace has shot up from 19% to 30% in the last five years. Magically arriving at the same exorbitant rate that Apple and Google are taking in their digital marketplaces.
This has been achieved by tying more and more overpriced-but-necessary services to its basic 15% cut. First Amazon basically made it a requirement to use them for storage and …</p>

I felt fairly confident about some of the topics, but I felt somewhat out of my depth when it came to some of the newer modern additions to browsers. The last few modules in particular were unexplored areas for me, with topics like screen configurations and media features. I learned a lot about those topics by writing about them.
Best of all, I got to put my new-found knowledge to use! Here’s how…

The environmental impact of the digital world is often one of those &#x27;out of sight, out of mind&#x27; kind of things.

            >Ask HN: I&#x27;m terrible at design (back end dev)</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the years I&#x27;ve started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and couldn&#x27;t improve them.
Common advice for people like me is to use a framework and/or template. I&#x27;ve used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I&#x27;ve spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.
I&#x27;ve also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.
It&#x27;s hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello!
In the last few months I&#x27;ve worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.codedraft
The main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that&#x27;s why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.
Another feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https://app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.
The web app can also be opened from the &quot;Scan Code&quot; tab in the mobile app.
I&#x27;ve always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!

While the French president is talking about &quot;pissing off the unvaccinated&quot;, the Australians are trying to a martyr of Djokovic, and the Americans continue to render everything virus through the basic two-way political tribal lens, Denmark is doing something else.
I already wrote about the curious state of affairs that in a country with extremely high levels of trust in government, just 40% of parents have decided to vaccinate their 5-11 year-old kids. Despite a strong, persistent recommendation from the health authorities to do so. Well, that was two weeks ago. The vaccination rate hasn&#x27;t budged since. Meaning the vaccine drive for that age group has…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve changed my mind on a lot of topics over the last few years, and it&#x27;s frankly been exhilarating. Especially if the topic had been one left unquestioned for a long time. To me, it feels similar to the rush of solving a hard problem. When the pieces suddenly fit into place, and an elegant solution emerges, you can&#x27;t help but smile.
Take nuclear power. I vividly remember the stickers from the 80s opposing it. Even looking them today, it brings warm and fuzzy memories. Together with that era&#x27;s activism, like the Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior. And fundraising as a kid for the Brazilian rain forest.
Further more, it seemed like a settled question: The future of energy is wind and solar! Of course it is. Renewables with no downsides, right? Wrong. Michael Shellenberger&#x27;s exposition of energy sou…</p>

            >HTML is general, ARIA is specific</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed 
 element should have, if any…
The proposed 
 element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a 
 or a  but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?
All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.
What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.
HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. 
? Sure, that can be a div. ? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. ? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a  and a  for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.
There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 98 beta was released on January 6, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in early February, 2022.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. Its usage in Chrome has declined
significantly over the last year. SDES is
removed because it is a
security problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that
entities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert
the Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">JavaScript provides a handful of methods and techniques for looping over arrays and elements and doing things with them. So… which approach should you use, and why?
Today, we’re going to look at the different ways you can loop over things with vanilla JS, and when and why to choose one over the other.
Let’s dig in!

            >The merit of hiring by merit</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve spent years pushing back against hiring practices based on years of irrelevance, pedigree gates, and brainteasers. These indirect measures of talent have proven both unreliable and unfair. If you can, why not look directly at merit?
When it comes to programmers, that merit is chiefly their ability to program! And program well. It&#x27;s not the only thing that matters, and being a good programmer isn&#x27;t alone sufficient to be hired at Basecamp, but it is a prerequisite. It doesn&#x27;t matter what else is true about you, if your programming chops aren&#x27;t up to par, there&#x27;s not going to be a job offer. 
So far, so uncontroversial, you&#x27;d think? But I&#x27;m increasingly seeing this basic lean on merit, as the key hiring assessment, becoming contested. Perhaps that started with the broad attempt to discr…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Each of us, in our own way, is in search of something greater, or just something that can give greater meaning to our lives. We are longing to become whole. Yet we’re far too busy looking for answers outside of ourselves, and relying too much on distractions, stimulants, materialism, and every possible thing we can think of that we believe will give us the meaning we long for.   


Meanwhile, we all have thousands and thousands of thoughts that go through our minds daily, and we do very little to regulate its activity. But there is a way to reign in our busy internal dialogue and allow ourselves to experience life’s beauty and hidden meaning. What’s more, it’s available to each of us, free of charge.  


A Mindfulness practice, in which we pause the busy-ness of our minds, puts us into pre…</p>

Sandbox, tracking the milestones on
the path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more
private web. Normally, we share an overview of updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline along with news from across
the project, but December was a quiet month. Instead, we&#x27;ll look back at some of
the activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make
now we are in the new year.

For a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the

Reassigning the variable Let’s say you have an array of wizards, like this.
let wizards &#x3D; [&#x27;Gandalf&#x27;, &#x27;Radagast&#x27;, &#x27;Merlin&#x27;];  You want to completely wipe it out. The most common way to do this is to reassign the value of the wizards variable to an empty array ([]).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.
Still, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.
In 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.
It all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public
websites as part of the
Private Network Access (PNA)
specification.
Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private
network request for a subresource, which asks
for explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will
carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the
response to it must carry a corresponding header,
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
targeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have
affected hundreds of thousands of users,
allowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite
gradient flavors.
In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an
evolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by
adding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse
for crisp and compact font files that compress well.
Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports
COLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.
# Color now
On the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does
not define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be
placed. That&#x27;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a
color. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that to…</p>

            >It&#x27;s not a lottery</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there&#x27;s already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I&#x27;m just left thinking: What&#x27;s the point? Do people think this is a lottery?
This isn&#x27;t unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don&#x27;t even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?
Maybe that&#x27;s part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don&#x27;t even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I&#x27;m skeptical.
Either way, it&#x27;s not how we review applications at Basecamp. There&#x27;s a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don&#x27;t comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a &quot;manager of managers&quot; for the director of engineering).
You might think, what&#x27;s the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that&#x27;s it. But I think there&#x27;s a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I&#x27;m not getting callbacks, so I&#x27;ll put even less effort into the next opening.
I guess what I&#x27;m saying is make the effort or don&#x27;t bother. We&#x27;re not drawing names out of a hat here.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We just opened a position for a Director of Engineering to help us manage our rapidly expanding technical teams at Basecamp. We already have more programmers on staff than we&#x27;ve ever had, and we intend to double that crew within the next 12-18 months. We&#x27;re going all-in on becoming a multi-product business again, and that means hiring the managers needed to to cope with those ambitions.
Not just because of this rapid growth on the technical teams, but because the rest of the company is growing along with it. We&#x27;ll be bigger than we&#x27;ve ever been this January, and before the end of the year, we&#x27;ll be much bigger still. Wild to think that after almost twenty years in business, we&#x27;re suddenly on a fast track to crack a hundred employees.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team&#x27;s work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what&#x27;s happening across the company.
The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it&#x27;s a book, it&#x27;s obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn&#x27;t like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let&#x27;s look at something that was posted internally, today.

By default, macOS uses Apple’s TextEdit app for any text file, and it’s pretty bad. Years ago, on my old machine, I setup Sublime to be my default editor for everything, but couldn’t remember how I did.
I eventually stumbled onto a thread on StackExchange with a working solution. I wanted to document it here so I wouldn’t forget again next time.</p>

            >Faith in eventually</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.

During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.

There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.

It’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.

This is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.

Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it&#x27;s never right even after.

In the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!

 One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you don’t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.</p>

            >It could be worse</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I grew up with persistent reminders of how any bad thing that happened could easily have been worse. Oh, you scraped your knee? It could be worse, you could have broken your leg! Oh, you broke your leg? It could be worse, you could have cracked your skull! Oh, you cracked your skull? It could be worse, you could have died!
It wasn&#x27;t just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control. The way to make those setbacks and the inevitable suffering in life bearable was to constantly remind yourself that... it could be worse!
Any student of Stoicism will recognize this pattern of mental fortification. It&#x27;s closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality. And the ultimate resilience to face the struggles of living lies in controlling our reactions to the things that happen. Our reactions are not given. They can be changed.
I wish there was more of that today. More &quot;it could be worse&quot;. Less &quot;this is the worst thing ever&quot;.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Whenever I dive into something new, I try to find at least one “why the hell not?” moment. And when I can, I try to leave evidence of that moment in whatever it is that I’m building.

When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us.

One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or…</p>

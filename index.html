            >Towards an animation smoothness metric</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You&#x27;ve probably experienced pages that &quot;stutter&quot; or &quot;freeze&quot; during scrolling or
animations. We like to say that these experiences are not smooth. To address
these types of issues, the Chrome team has been working on adding more support
to our lab tooling for animation detection, as well making steady improvements
to the rendering pipeline diagnostics within Chromium.
We&#x27;d like to share some recent progress, offer concrete tooling guidance, and
discuss ideas for future animation smoothness metrics. As always, we would love
to hear your feedback.
This post will cover three main topics:
A quick look at animations and animation frames.
Our current thoughts on measuring overall animation smoothness.
A few practical suggestions for you to leverage in lab tooling today.

            >Feedback wanted: An experimental responsiveness metric</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Earlier this year, the Chrome Speed Metrics Team shared some of the
ideas we were considering for a
new responsiveness metric. We want to design a metric that better captures the
end-to-end latency of individual events and offers a more holistic picture of
the overall responsiveness of a page throughout its lifetime.
We&#x27;ve made a lot of progress on this metric in the last few months, and we
wanted to share an update on how we plan to measure interaction latency as well
as introduce a few specific aggregation options we&#x27;re considering to quantify
the overall responsiveness of a web page.
We&#x27;d love to get feedback from developers and site owners as to
which of these options would be most representative of the overall input
responsiveness of their pages.

            >Are design patterns relevant with Golang?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m really confused on this. My understanding on Golang&#x27;s intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you&#x27;d do with classic OO.
Yet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they&#x27;re not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.
Unsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi, every one,
As the title suggest, I am a react native developer and I wanted to get a job at FAANG.
From various resources, I’ve come to know that at the starting of career, joining at FAANG may not be a good idea.
So, My initial plan is
 try get selected for internship at siliconvalleyinternship.com/
after spending there 2 years then go for FAANG.
But, Life may not go according to plan. So, I am trying for both.
According to my research, 
I’ve to be good at what I am doing, in my case it will JavaScript, and Design implementation. 
I also have be good at Data Structure and Algorithm
Little Bit about myself:
Top 8% ( 458 reputation ) in Stack Overflow in 2021 ( https://stackoverflow.com/users/14302873/mrpmohiburrahman ) 
I am working as a React Native Developer since 30th December, 2020.
I do not have any kind project to show case
I am willing to work with anything as long as it’s Functional Programming with JS.
This is my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrpmohiburrahman/
What do you suggest?
How can I prepare myself so that I’ll be able to join FAANG as a Front End developer or as JS developer on any stack?

You can use them even if you do not have tiles on your floor. If you are getting your house remodeled and want to remove the existing tiles, then you can paste them on top of the floors instead of undergoing the hassle of retiling.

120 new icons
This update was a lot of fun for me—drawing all these tiny computer parts most of all! There are dozens of new computer related icons for parts, ports, and peripheral devices. There are also several new brand icons, including Meta, and some other fun icons like a new robot head and a boombox.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:

Scott pointed out that some screenreaders wouldn’t announce the change to the button text when the button is clicked.

            >Force Chrome major version to 100 in the User-Agent string</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the first half of 2022, Chrome will reach a three-digit major version number:
100!  When browsers first reached version 10 many eons ago,
lots of issues were discovered
with User-Agent parsing libraries as the major version number went from one
digit to two.  Now that we are approaching version 100 in both Chrome and
Firefox, with Edge not far behind, we want to detect possible issues related
to three-digit version number early, so we are ready when it becomes a reality.
Starting in Chrome 96, until Chrome 99, a feature flag will be available to force the User-Agent
string to use the major version number 100, regardless of the actual major version
number. It will apply to both the User-Agent request header and the Javascript
APIs (for example, navigator.userAgent).
Similar experiments
are being run on Firefox as well.
Visit
Is Chrome 100 yet? to
check if your browser is sending the major version 100 in the User-Agent
string.
To turn the flag on in Chrome and experiment, type chrome://flags in the address bar and enable
the #force-major-version-to-100 flag.
Visiting
Is Chrome 100 yet?
after enabling the flag reports that the User-Agent has major version number 100.
The goal is to uncover as many issues as possible ahead of time, so send your
bug reports to
Web Compat
and help prepare the web for three-digit major browser version numbers!</p>

 Awkward. Funny how a lot of sites are completely blank with JavaScript disabled.
 Stefan Krieger replied (in good faith, I think)…
 Disabling CSS they look even worse. No, seriously, is there a proper reason to disable JS in 2021?
 I hear this question a lot.
Some people do disable JavaScript—for privacy reasons, or because their device is old and JavaScript makes it run a lot slower.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I had an extra long weekend recently. It was four days of being a culture vulture. It was also four days of ever-increasing risk assessment.
It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.

However, I wanted to make it tidier and cheaper (to a potential user) which I alluded to at the end of the part 1 post.
I did just that, and produced 30 custom PCBs with a custom 3D printed housing which have all been sold and sent to people across the globe, including the UK, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan.</p>

Silently, the imposing Horseman quickly becomes all the auditor can perceive, as an inaccessible overlay fog dims all but the imposing figure. It dismounts, and what seems almost instantly, stands mere feet in front of the lone auditor. A headingless mass with no immediately perceivable purpose. At least, none other than to incite confusion and dread to all that wander too close to the source code.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I&#x27;m willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary&#x60; or &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: all&#x60;.
2. The fact that I don&#x27;t, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I&#x27;ll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: no&#x60;, or &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: yes&#x60;.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like &#x60;X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters&#x60;.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Three years ago, I shared an approach for creating autoexpanding textarea elements with vanilla JS. On a recent project, I decided to search for a more modern way to automatically expand textarea elements as the user types, and stumbled upon this solution from Stephen Shaw that I think is far superior.
First, you wrap your textarea in a div.
Type something 
  
 You use CSS Grid to link the sizing of the parent div and the textarea together.</p>

But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

And now Open Graph images.
Get a sneak peek at an early version of the Eleventy API Explorer.
Open Graph images are those little pictures that show up when your site is shared on social media. I made the ones on my site better recently.
And while it was nice to have some prettier things displaying on social media—I wanted to reuse the visuals on my own web site too. So, I built an image service that would find the Open Graph images for a web page.
I’m now using it on my home page:
The image service:
Takes a URL
Looks at the markup for that URL and finds the Open Graph image in use
Resizes and optimizes the image
Returns the result

The article is based on a single self selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views.
This study breaks the BBC’s own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.
The article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry picked individual cases.
The article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Season three of the Clearleft podcast is done and dusted. I’m pretty happy with how the six episodes turned out.
Episode one
Coaching. There was one question at the heart of this episode: what’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentoring? I got some great answers to that question, with some good stories along the way.
Episode two
Design Engineering. It will come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this episode. This is a topic I think is growing in importance. The relevation for me was the way Trys framed it less as the intersection between design and development, and more about the gap between design and development. And remember we’re looking for a design engineer to join Clearleft.
Episode three

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I hadn&#x27;t realised that Medium had made JavaScript a requirement to be able to read any Medium post - I&#x27;d had JS disabled for ages on Medium just because of all the extra cruft they added.
But now, without JS, you only get the first few lines of content, and the rest is loaded entirely with JS - which… is stupid.
Scribe fixes all that and focuses entirely on the author&#x27;s content.
I also used the FAQ to auto redirect and now I can read the full content without being distracted by Medium&#x27;s horrid cruft.
Great example of taking back the web.

in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. 


What is the EyeDropper API? #
Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the
entire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.
Photoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don&#x27;t have to guess a color
and risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,
useful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper
you can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don&#x27;t have to remember or copy the
color code from somewhere else.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My kids hold beef. And they hold it forever. If one kid in the neighborhood did something they’ll talk about it every other day like it happened yesterday. The friend’s neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you’ve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don’t get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that’s good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don’t know. And it doesn’t matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they’ll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying “But remember that time…”
I don’t get it. I don’t see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn’t a beef holder either. She’s one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the last three years, Chrome has been working to empower web applications that want to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible in the browser. One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.
In this post, we&#x27;d like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web. You can use all the APIs Adobe used and more in your own apps as well. Be sure to check out our web capabilities related blog posts for inspiration and watch our API tracker for the latest and greatest we&#x27;re working on.

I was working on a side-project this weekend, and the :not() pseudo-selector made my life a lot easier!
What the :not() pseudo-selector does The :not() pseudo-selector lets you select elements, but exclude ones that match an additional set of selectors. Pass in the selectors to ignore as an argument.</p>

            >Ask HN: Language design to mitigate supply chain attacks?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

            >Pair programming sucks</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Josh Branchaud wrote a great thread on Twitter last week about pair programming.
 One of the most understated features of pair programming, and a big part of why it is “worth it”, is that you never really get stuck on something for several days, as can happen often when soloing…
Your pair keeps your assumptions in check.
A pair helps you pump the brakes and clarify up front the assumptions about why something is broken or the assumptions about how to implement a feature.</p>

            >Ask HN: Is starting a web design and hosting business viable today?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi everyone,
I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).
She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I&#x27;m currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I&#x27;m getting more and more bored every day.
However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I&#x27;m not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I&#x27;ve done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.
Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)

Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 
Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Mark Brown from Game Maker’s Toolkit is making a game. After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.
What is the right direction? Well… the answer is: Prototypes.
Mark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn’t any fun. Mark said it felt shallow, repetitive, and dull. In his own words:
It comes down to making two very wrong assumptions. Assumption #1 is the game always felt kind of cool in my head, so I just kind of assumed the game wo…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 96 beta was released on October 21, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late November, 2021.
# The &quot;basic-card&quot; method of PaymentRequest API
The PaymentRequest API has deprecated the basic card payment
method. Its usage is low
and declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in
time-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment
methods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung
Pay.
# Removal timeline
Chrome 96
The basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.
Chrome 100
The basic-card method will be removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            >Auto Dark Theme</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome 96 introduces an Origin Trial for Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to light themed sites,
when the user has opted into dark themes in the Operating System.
Users can opt-out of dark themes by either disabling the option on the OS level or in a specific setting in Chrome.
# Sign-up for the Origin Trial
You can also enable the darkening algorithm for your users, via an Origin Trial.
This will allow you to test how the Auto Dark Theme performs with regards to your KPIs.
Head over to the documentation to learn
how to set up an Origin Trial,
then sign-up for the AutoDarkMode origin trial to get a token.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Russ, here, CTO and cofounder of Rainforest QA (https://www.rainforestqa.com). Way back in 2012, my cofounder Fred (fredsters_s) and I got into YC with one idea in mind, but soon pivoted once we saw a pattern among most of the other companies in our cohort.
These startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality. Given that we were sure CI/CD would be the future of software development, we decided to dedicate our start…</p>

As an example, it wanted to allow developers to create interactive menus, much like those found in desktop applications. But that’s not all. It also wanted to allow developers to modify a browser’s OS-level context menus, injecting custom menu items for users to discover… and of course, to be delighted by.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">There has arguably never been a better time to be working with CSS. We have so many more tools available at our disposal than even just a couple of years ago. Scroll snap, Motion Path, Level 5 Media Queries and CSS functions min(), max() and clamp() are just some of the CSS features that have got me excited in the last year or two, but even these are old-hat compared to the buzz around container queries, or LCH colours, for instance. It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change, but as a developer I would argue that one of the most important qualities to have is curiosity. That doesn’t mean instantly adopting new tools and features the second they arrive (and burning yourself out trying to keep up). It means being open to the possibility that there might be a better way of doing somet…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For the past year I’ve been on a team of folks inside Open UI dedicated to figuring out how get a native, accessible  element into HTML. We’re a team of people with varying backgrounds; spec authors, browser vendors, implementors, and normie practitioners like myself. Open UI is a community group so we can’t technically make HTML (for legal reasons), but we can present research to the W3C working groups. I see Open UI as an ad hoc research arm for the W3C with specific experience in design systems and common web componentry.
The “Tabvengers” as we’re known, have produced a couple research documents and experiments so far:
Research  documenting a lot of the common parts and features of tabs; an interface inventory across a matrix of design systems and implementations

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I want to design a back in stock notification email service, where the users can sign up on the out-of-stock page and get notified when the item is back in stock.
If I have the list of users subscribed to back in stock alert and another table that has latest stock availability, what would be the best appraoch to build an efficient system that looks at these data and trigger back in stock email ?
- Do I poll the stock table for change in stock and then compare with user table and trigger email ? 
- Is there any other better ways of doing it ? Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.
I am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
no, you didn’t miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.

            >Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority in an attempt to download resources in an optimal order. These priorities can depend on the kind of resource and where it is in the document. For example, in-viewport images may have a High priority while the priority for early 
 loaded, render-blocking CSS in the 
 could be Very High. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities that work well but may not be optimal in all cases.
In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss Priority Hints and the importance attribute, which allow you to hint at the relative importance of a resource (high or low). Priority Hints can help optimize the Core Web Vitals.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Ahmad Shadeed recently published an article where he dug into Facebook’s implementation of the border-radius property on their card components. He had noticed, upon inspecting Facebook’s CSS, that the value for border-radius seemed quite convoluted for what amounted to a value of 8px:
.card {
  border-radius: max(0px, min(8px, calc((100vw - 4px - 100%) * 9999)));
}
After some investigation, Ahmad discovered that this line of CSS was, in fact, a “toggle” — where under some conditions (namely, when the card was less than the full width of the viewport), the toggle would be “flipped”, and the computed value evaluating to 0px. (Read the full article for details of how this works.)

And… it works! If you’re wondering why I made this, the tl;dr is that Sass has a superior way of adjusting the alpha channel on ANY COLOR (rgb, hsl, named color, etc) but that does not work with CSS Custom Properties. This little paint worklet restores that flavor of color manipulation to backgrounds and borders. Here’s a video with a more in-depth explanation:

Nearly all web apps depend on routing in some way whether it&#x27;s code running
on a server that maps a path to files on disk or logic in a single-page app
that updates the DOM when the URL changes. URLPattern is a new web
platform API that standardizes routing pattern syntax.

            >Ask HN: How do you design UI components?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi HN,
I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.
For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.
The most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.
That could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.
But I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 &quot;blobs&quot; on it that represent min, max and most likely.
The advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.
I then went on Google to see if there is any research to &quot;Designing Components&quot; but I&#x27;m kinda overwhelmed by &quot;top 10 UI/UX component&quot; answers and MATERIAL.
So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This is an API guide with detailed usage examples for the Reporting
  API (v1), which uses the Reporting-Endpoints header. If you&#x27;re already using the legacy
  Reporting API (Report-To header), head over to the migration post
  instead. 

Some errors only occur in production. You won&#x27;t see them locally or during development because
real users, real networks, and real devices change the game. The Reporting API helps
catch some of these errors⏤such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API
calls⏤across your site, and transmits them to an endpoint you&#x27;ve specified. It lets you declare what
you&#x27;d like to monitor via HTTP headers, and is operated by the browser.
Setting up the Reporting API gives you peace of mind that when users experience these types of
errors, you&#x27;ll…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This post covers how to migrate to the new version of the Reporting
  API (v1). If you&#x27;re new to the Reporting API or need detailed usage examples, head over to the main
  post on the Reporting API instead. 

The Reporting API informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.
A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.
The legacy Reporting API is named Reporting API v0. The new Reporting API is named
Reporting API v1.

View slides on Notist
This talk had two major objectives. Firstly, In January 2021 I joined the W3C Web Components Community Group, which is hoping to advance Web Components and raise awareness. It’s a worthwhile cause to get over some of Web Components’ historical marketing problems. I also get a chance to provide feedback on nascent stage proposals. I’m a fringe member in this group, but happy to escalate any questions or feedback you have.
The second reason I wanted to talk about Web Components is that I feel there’s an education gap.  I noticed that nearly all the people I know that love HTML, CSS, and Design System…</p>

I’m financially engaged with Kevin and I like Texas BBQ, so I thought I’d go. I also thought my former neighbor Cleo was going to be there and wouldn’t it be fun to surprise her.
Cleo didn’t show up. Foiled! I thought she always went to this thing. Ugh. Okay. Reset. I made due, grabbed a plat of free BBQ and sat down. I was now on my own in a sea of retirees running the same free BBQ grift I was running. There were two people under 60: my financial advisor and the person he invited to be the guest speaker. I failed at making small talk, so my tablemates and I sat the long table poking at our meats and the conversation centered around passing the potato salad.

            >Why don’t video games take sex seriously?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This week I came across an article titled “Why don’t video games take sex seriously?”… so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I’m a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he’s a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I’m not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang’s work.
Back to the article about video game sex. One particular passage stuck out to me…

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta The way we view life is usually invisible to us, and yet it is probably the most powerful thing in our lives. For example, one person might hear the words of another person and feel incredibly hurt, stressed, angry, and then it ruins their entire week … while another person might hear […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few very interesting discussions on Twitter have led me to understand that some folks are talking about Lighthouse scores in a way that is—in my opinion—not as forthright as it could be (intentionally or not). Let’s level set a bit and talk a bit about the different flavors of wiggle room:
Super Fast Hardware #
Here’s a screenshot of a Lighthouse result from this morning, October 14th, 2021, run on an old MacBook Air (2012) using Chrome 86.
Here’s the same result on my MacBook Air (M1, 2020) using Chrome 94:
It’s incredible to me the variability effect that your hardware can have: from a 64 on Performance to a 94—that’s a thirty point swing!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it’s sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.
Episode six is all about design principles. That’s a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.
But for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.
Katie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite’s time for her to talk me through it. I’ve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.
It’s nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.

And with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!</p>

Overview #
Users are often presented with items, sometimes lots of items, and in these
cases it can be a good idea to provide a way to reduce the list to prevent
choice overload. This
blog post explores filtering UI as a way to reduce choices. It does this by
presenting item attributes that users can select or deselect, reducing results
and therefore reducing choice overload.
Interactions #
The goal is to enable swift traversal of filter options for all users and their
varying input types. This will be delivered with an adaptable and responsive
pair of components. A traditional sidebar of checkboxes for…</p>

With that in mind, I’m trying not to be judgemental about the decisions other people are making (apart from the decsion not to get vaccinated—I’m judgemental as hell about those selfish assholes). For example, I wear a mask when I’m on public transport. Other people don’t. I try not to judge them (although re…</p>

Even today, I only understand a relatively small portion of it.
I&#x27;m grateful for the time given to me during this period.

            >Assessing loading performance in the field with Navigation Timing and Resource Timing</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">If you&#x27;ve used connection throttling in the network panel in a browser&#x27;s developer tools (or Lighthouse in Chrome) to assess loading performance, you know how convenient those tools are for performance tuning. You can quickly measure the impact of performance optimizations with a consistent and stable baseline connection speed. The only problem is that this is synthetic testing, which yields lab data, not field data.
Synthetic testing isn&#x27;t inherently bad, but it&#x27;s not representative of how fast your website is loading for real users. That requires field data, which you can collect from the Navigation Timing and Resource Timing APIs.

Overview
The custom waterfall page got a significant redesign
WebPageTest now uses Chrome&#x27;s Dev Tools priorities
The Element Timing API is now supported
The Locations API endpoint can be filtered by a single location
We now warn you if we think your TTFB might be inaccurate
Custom waterfall redesign and dynamic adjustments
One of the (many) features that is a little tucked away in WebPageTest is the ability to customize the waterfall by choosing what metrics and information to hide or display, truncating the waterfall to a given duration and even zooming in on individual requests.

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I’m particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.
Some highlights…

The big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It’s thrice weekly’ish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel. I wrote a bit about it, but Chris and I are having a good time making videos. We’re up to 12 videos so far. That’s a helluva cadence so there’ll be some breaks, but so far feels pretty sustainable.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A new episode of the Clearleft podcast just dropped and I have to say, this is one of my favourites so far. It’s all about measuring design.
There was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn’t there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?
For this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.
This episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it’s well worth your time. Have a listen.

This is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Philip Walton on the difficulties the webperf community faces when discussing web performance. Simple numbers don’t cut it. We need to provide context when discussing performance results.
What concerns me about this practice is that it glosses over a lot of important nuance, and it perpetuates the idea that synthetic or lab-based tools (like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and many others) are genuine and precise assessments of a site’s actual, real-world performance—rather than what they are: tools to test, debug, diagnose, optimize, and predict performance or detect regressions under a set of controlled conditions.
I’m definitely guilty of the simplicity he discusses. Thanks for the challenge Philip.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Applications deal with untrusted strings all the time, but safely rendering that content as part of an HTML document can be tricky. Without sufficient care, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally create opportunities for cross-site scripting (XSS) that malicious attackers may exploit.
To mitigate that risk, the new Sanitizer API proposal aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page. This article introduces the API, and explains its usage.
// Expanded Safely !!
$div.setHTML(&#x60;hello world&#x60;, new Sanitizer())
Escaping user input #
When inserting user input, query strings, cookie contents, and so on, into the DOM, the strings must be escaped properly. Particular attention should be paid to DOM manipulation via .innerHTML, where…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Bootstrap v5.1.2 is here with a handful of improvements across our components, plus a fix for an issue in another project that prevented our Sass from compiling properly. Keep reading for the highlights.
Highlights
Temporarily patched a postcss-values-parser issue by rearranging our calc() functions that use negative numbers. This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap’s Sass in create-react-app.
Added border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects
Added align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers
Fixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children
Updated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN
Improved docs around .img-fluid
Added role&#x3D;&quot;switch&quot; to our form switches in our docs
Implemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.
Up next
Up next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we’ll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap

            >Best practices for using third-party embeds</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Many sites use third-party embeds to create an engaging user experience by delegating some sections of a web page to another content provider. The most common examples of third-party content embeds are video players, social-media feeds, maps, and advertisements.
Third-party content can impact the performance of a page in many ways. It can be render-blocking, contend with other critical resources for network and bandwidth, or affect the Core Web Vitals metrics. Third-party embeds may also cause layout shifts as they load. This article discusses performance best practices that you can use when loading third-party embeds, efficient loading techniques, and the Layout Shift Terminator tool that helps reduce layout shifts for popular embeds.

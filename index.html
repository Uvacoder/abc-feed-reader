# What is the accessibility tree?
Assistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The spread syntax operator (...) takes an array or object (or other iterable) and expands its items into their own individual values.
let sandwiches &#x3D; [&#x27;tuna&#x27;, &#x27;turkey&#x27;, &#x27;pb&amp;j&#x27;]; // logs [&quot;tuna&quot;, &quot;turkey&quot;, &quot;pb&amp;j&quot;] console.log(sandwiches); // logs tuna turkey pb&amp;j console.log(...sandwiches);  The spread operator can only be used inside of functions, arrays and objects. You cannot use it on its own.
This, for example, would throw an error.
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;.</p>

            >Ask HN: Why do developers like boring design?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For example, HN has a boring design that could benefit from improvements (e.g., make it easier to up/down-vote, navigate threads easier, etc.) and yet, many people like it this way.
Another example: Most devs that I know prefer CLI over GUI, even when GUI makes their life easier.
I&#x27;m not saying pragmatic design doesn&#x27;t have its place, but too much minimalism and simplicity is also not good IMO. In the HN example, some simple JS elements or better CSS wouldn&#x27;t hurt.

Since our last update, we’ve continued to see improvements
in all browsers. All browsers started with much lower test scores at the beginning of the year, but
now all browsers have surpassed 90%! This means the web platform has significantly improved
interoperability of the five focus areas.

I don&#x27;t just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter.

If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar.

This is how mosts economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few years ago, skeuomorphism was wildly popular. From Windows XP, Vista, 7 to iOS (before v6) and android. But it seems after iOS 6, almost everybody jumped on the bandwagon of flat design. Google introduced Material and Microsoft offered Metro and later Acrylic (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/).
But now we see some trends like in iOS that show that designers are embracing some of the intuitive aspects of skeuomorphism. For example, iOS icons have some depth now and look more 3D.
Why is this happening?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s tempting to believe that powerful people and organizations are conspiring in secret to cause mysterious or unfair events to occur. The conspiracies supposedly involve dozens of people working across many time zones in complete secrecy. That’s truly unlikely. Unlikely because cooperation of this sort is hard to find, especially among the powerful, and because […]</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 7, 2021 12:40 AM GMT

Last year I discovered, much to my chagrin, that always-on internet socializing was costly for me. This was inconvenient both because I’d spent rather a lot of time singing the praises of social media and instant messaging, and because we were in the middle of a global pandemic that had made online socializing an almost physical necessity. I made the decision at the time to put off changing my social media diet, and that was correct. But now there is in-person socializing again, and I’m changing how I use social media and messaging. I wanted to talk about this process and how great it was for me, but kept being nagged by the thought that the internet was full of essays about how the internet is bad, all of which I ignored or actively fought with,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last month I wrote about writing on web.dev. At that time, the first five parts of a fifteen-part course on responsive design had been published. I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:
Typography
Responsive images
The picture element
Icons
Theming
It wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.
The final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi folks, I&#x27;m building a social media app on Dart. I&#x27;ve been working on it for some time but it always bugs me whether I&#x27;m making a right choice by picking it over React.
Right now my plan is to build an MVP, apply to YC and then maybe keep Dart long term. Also, Our team is more familiar with Dart than React. We need a language which can work cross platform and is simpler to implement features.
Thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Watching science fiction shows/movies/games/comics/etc, the user interfaces are rather magnificent. But they rarely use elements from what people actually use.  And in actual user interfaces, there isn&#x27;t much that get&#x27;s used in SciFi.  Why is there such a large gap in these designs?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a given that Facebook, Twitter, et al, are designed to monopolize people&#x27;s attention and energy. This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.
I&#x27;ve seen several submissions by HNers working on &#x27;friendlier&#x27; social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.
This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I&#x27;ve tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.

Chen Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer living in Singapore, with an inordinate love for CSS, as evidenced by her blog (which is mostly about CSS) and her tweets (which are largely about typography and the web). She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions, and hopes to be able to climb outdoors one day. I talked to her about CSS, and in particular non-English writing systems.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company whose products offer digital end-to-end solutions for real estate. This year, we carried out a project focused on improving the performance of a content hub in our app, and had encouraging results in increasing user traffic and conversion metrics.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I can completely see why Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast has become so popular. I&#x27;ve listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn&#x27;t have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan&#x27;s, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?
Such basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days. On many of the most controversial issues, even partaking in a conversation with &quot;the other side&quot; is often derided as &quot;…</p>

What resources can you recommend that teaches you about which layouts work best for different types of websites, different navigation styles (better to have it on the top/side/tucked because of Y), how to match colors and typography, etc?

Overview #
Toasts are non-interactive, passive, and asynchronous short messages for users.
Generally they are used as an interface feedback pattern for informing the user
about the results of an action.
Toast

Android 


Interactions #
Toasts are unlike notifications,
alerts and
prompts because
they&#x27;re not interactive; they&#x27;re not meant to be dismissed or persist.
Notifications are for more important information, synchronous messaging that
requires interaction, or system level messages (as opposed to page level).
Toasts are more passive than other notice strategies.

Hans Moravec:  Behold my book Mind Children.  Within, I project that, in 2010 or thereabouts, we shall achieve strong AI.  I am not calling it &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot; because this term will not be coined for another 15 years or so.
Eliezer (who is not actually on the record as saying this, because the real Eliezer is, in this scenario, 8 years old; this version of Eliezer has all the meta-heuristics of Eliezer from 2021, but none of that Eliezer&#x27;s anachronistic knowledge):  Really?  That sounds like a very difficult prediction to make correctly, since it is about the future, which is famously hard to predict.
Imaginary Moravec:  Sounds like a fully general counterargument to me.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">After Google’s Core Web Vitals announcement, performance became an important metric to our client’s—one that they knew they had to stay ahead of the curve on. As an agency, Versantus helps businesses solve technical problems with intelligent digital solutions, so we’ve always built websites that perform well. However, the Core Web Vitals updates have meant every detail, millisecond and image are now under the microscope.
Some of our clients, who were working with marketing agencies, received site recommendations to implement for improved performance metrics. For many others, performance simply moved up the agenda because of Core Web Vitals’ impact on search engine rankings. To give our client’s the best chance of high performance scoring, we knew we had to take a process-driven approach.

A handful of developers who are just learning they have ADHD have asked me what tools and systems and approaches work for me, so today I wanted to talk about that a bit.
Let’s dig in!
tl;dr: I’ve learned to embrace my ADHD, and work with it instead of against it.

But because writing and updating HTML like that never felt like an appropriate solution for the kind of apps I was interested in writing.

 I don’t understand the “things were better in the late 2000s” school of web development thinking going around lately. Maybe it’s nostalgia for when people first started? Or not wanting to learn new things?
Either way, no! I assure you, things are SOOO much better now. 😄

            >RBAC: Design for users belonging to multiple roles</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. 
We have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.
A user can have different roles in each sub org.
E.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.
Now user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.
Now when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.
In standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.
Also we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.
Is there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In most pyramids, the top gets all the attention, but it’s the foundation that truly matters. Marketing is no exception. The base of the pyramid, the most important layer, is INTENTION. What change are you seeking to make? Does the team have clarity, measurements and resources to prioritize this? Intention comes with design thinking. Who’s […]</p>

            >The UI fund</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome has launched a fund to support the UI ecosystem. We designed this fund to provide grants to people who work on design tools, CSS, and HTML.
All of us who work on the web regularly benefit from the work of people who create specifications, tools, demos, tutorials, and polyfills. Many of these resources are side projects, made available and supported free of charge. They exist because someone saw a need, created something to meet it, then shared it with the rest of the ecosystem.
We want to recognize and help support this work and invest in the CSS ecosystem. We&#x27;re excited to enable people to spend time on these projects and create more value for the web.

Now, to continue, you might want to consider these five ideas that can potentially boost your productivity as a freelancer.


Go Easy on the Multitasking


We’ll state for the record that we think multitasking is a great skill that every person should cultivate. It can come in handy when you’re in a tight pinch and need to think on the fly. 


Most of the time, however, doing more than what you should be doing is actually contrary to your goal of productivity. If you want to accomplish as many tasks as humanly possible in a day, the ability to focus is th…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The three-part almost nine-hour long documentary Get Back is quite fascinating.
First of all, the fact that all this footage exists is remarkable. It’s as if Disney had announced that they’d found the footage for a film shot between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.
Still, does this treasure trove really warrant the daunting length of this new Beatles documentary? As Terence puts it:
There are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering? The second problem is that it is far too short! Beatles obsessives (like me) could happily drink in a hundred hours of this stuff.
In some ways, watching Get Back is liking watching one of those Andy Warhol art projects where he just po…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 26, 2021 3:17 PM GMT

The goal of this essay is to help you understand EfficientZero, a reinforcement learning agent that obtains better-than-human median performance on a set of 26 Atari games after just two hours of real-time experience playing each game.
Specifically, it gets 116% of human median performance on the data-limited Atari 100k benchmark. The previously-best algorithm only reached about 41% of median human performance, so this is a reasonably large leap.
Chart stolen from paper

The benchmark is called 100k because agents only interact with the environment for 100,000 steps -- about two hours.  Note also that the human benchmarks were also set after the humans in question had about two hours of experience on the game.  So EfficientZero seems to -- at lea…</p>

            >Show HN: I made a book with a hundred UI/UX tips</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello.
This year I dived into UI/UX area and at the same time I work as a web developer. I sincerely love making good UI. But at my full time job it&#x27;s not always possible due to different reasons &#x3D;\
So I&#x27;ve been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).
I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.
This time it&#x27;s a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.
I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.
This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.

When we got a computer at home—an unusual device to own in the 1990s—I soon traded in the physical toys with computer games. I wasn&#x27;t an avid gamer though; I don&#x27;t think I ever finished a game entirely. Instead of finishing the games, I found myself modding them.

Last time I was on the show, I talked about how modern best practices were hurting the web. This time around, I was a bit more optimistic. We had a good discussion about some emerging trends that put the user’s needs on equal footing with the developer experience.

I&#x27;m looking to level up enough to be able to use design tools well + have an intuition for good vs bad design + be able to (hopefully) design well myself. Please assume I&#x27;m a complete noob. thanks in advance HN!

            >Don’t Forget the “lang” Attribute</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">An interesting notification from @cyishere popped up in my Twitter feed the other day:
I use a Chrome extension Read Aloud to read the web pages for improving my English. The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁
— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021
 
I replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!
The experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.
Speaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I teach a college-level intro to html/css/js to mostly business majors. We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare&#x27;s public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.
Is there a way to satisfy these reqs?
1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)
2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)
3. Is an IDE or IDE extension
4. Keeps some sort of version history
5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. At this point I want to say thank you to every single reader, to everyone who supports me, sends me feedback or suggestions. I love this project so much because my readership (you!) is so amazing.
When I looked up something these days in my archive, I realised how true the introduction from last year is still today.
On the topic of creating for the web: I personally think micro-typography, good translations and good content writing matters a lot to the success of a product. So I wrote an article on well crafted translations and why automation isn’t good enough yet, showing some prominent examples that just aren’t good enough.

This is the internet after all! Full of savage trolls! Surely we must fortify lest we be overrun?
But the trolls never came. Since we launched HEY World, every single one of the many thousands of posts made here have had a &quot;report abuse&quot; link at the bottom. Not once has it been used to report a posting that actually violated our use restrictions. Not. Once.
All that worry, all that consternation, all those arguments back and forth about policy and protocols, all for nothing.
Furthermore, HEY World is a pretty minimalist system. By design. The individual pages contain just five links: Link to the au…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a disorientating time in America. So many societal seams are unraveling simultaneously. So few ideas for how to stitch those seams back together find common cause. No wonder despair and anger comes so easy to so many right now.
These dark emotions are then propelled by the particle accelerator that is Twitter into super-charged takes. All that energy has definitively nuked any previous utopian hope that &quot;connecting the world&quot; would lead to peace, love, and understanding.
That, ironically, is perhaps the one thing everyone does seem to agree on at the moment: social media is making everything political worse. But of course such a conclusion is only shared until the question of who to blame emerges or what to do about it is brought up, and then it&#x27;s back to the tribal drums.

TLDR

There’s an organization based in London called the Rationalist Association. It was founded in 1885. Historically, it focused on publishing books and articles related to atheism and science, including works by Darwin, Bertrand Russell, J. B. S. Haldane, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Karl Popper.
The topics covered overlap with the present-day rationalist movement (centered on Lesswrong). They include religion and atheism, philosophy (especially philosophy of science and ethics), evolution, and psychology.
According to Wikipedia, membership of the Rationalist Association peaked in 1959 with more than 5000 members and with Bertrand Russell as President.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI &amp; Games YouTube channel breaks it down.
One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Historically, RS has nodes and slices. One node made of a given number of slices (varies by node type). Data is distributed over slices, and only the slice holding a block can access that block.
These days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.
So I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 ins…</p>

            >Ask HN: Any cooking/recipe websites with good UX?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I don&#x27;t know what it is about cooking and recipe-focused websites. They seem to be some of the worst in terms of pop ups, and superfluous garbage content. I spend so much time searching for the actual content on most pages because there are so many links to other crap.
For example, check out this Betty Crocker page where there&#x27;s about 300px of whitespace at the top, a huge useless picture of flour, and a navbar that doesn&#x27;t quite stick to the top of the page (viewing on Firefox) https://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/tipslibrary/charts-timetables-measuring/equivalent-measures-abbreviations
Another example is allrecipes.com. I think it fares pretty well on Desktop, but on my phone I notice they insert adds throughout the ingredient list and instructions. Also met with a full-screen popup from Amazon about Cyber Monday.
There&#x27;s gotta be some plain and simple sites out there, and I&#x27;d like to hear about them.

I could not find a way to report it, and given the millions they have invested in the rebranding, I am assuming they will consider it as one with high priority.

            >Quick tips on how to use the Algorithm Design Manual</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Ok so the high level breakdown:
1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.
2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples
3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;22hwcnXIGgk&amp;list&#x3D;PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx
4. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics
5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview
6. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn&#x27;t too valuable. 
7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out
Ultimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta This neverending pandemic hasn’t been the best mental health environment for many people — it has created raised levels of uncertainty, anxiety, loneliness, unhappiness, procrastination and feelings of dreariness for large numbers of people. That’s understandable, and I feel tremendous compassion for everyone who is suffering right now. I strongly believe that this […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.

Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.
I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.
NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.
Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello HN:
I have been developing apps for iOS and Android for about 10 years. Started with Objective C and Java and then moved to Swift and Kotlin. I don&#x27;t have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.
Have you switched from native to cross platform dev?
Have you tried both flutter and react native?
Which one did you prefer and why?
Thanks!
Edit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:
1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).
2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 19, 2021 12:00 AM GMT

I’m an independent researcher working on AI alignment and the theory of agency. I’m 29 years old, will make about $90k this year, and set my own research agenda. I deal with basically zero academic bullshit - my grant applications each take about one day’s attention to write (and decisions typically come back in ~1 month), and I publish the bulk of my work right here on LessWrong/AF. Best of all, I work on some really cool technical problems which I expect are central to the future of humanity.

            >Programmers should stop celebrating incompetence</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the valiant effort to combat imposter syndrome and gatekeeping, the programming world has taken a bad turn down a blind alley by celebrating incompetence. You don&#x27;t have to reduce an entire profession to a clueless gang of copy-pasta pirates to make new recruits feel welcome. It undermines the aspiration to improve. It reduces the work to magical thinking. It is not good.
I say this an evaluation of the prescription, not of the diagnosis. The programming world absolutely has had, and still has, challenges with imposter syndrome and gatekeeping. In large part because, unlike so many other professional fields, a high percentage of the people working in programming are self-taught. (Including yours truly!).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m a fan of logical properties in CSS. As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.
Alaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!
More than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.
It’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…</p>

Let’s dig in!
An object of arguments If I have just two or three parameters, I’ll accept them as individual arguments just like you would expect.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers / Cypress / Puppeteer / Playwright / others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what &quot;frameworks of the future&quot; should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being &quot;good enough&quot; for the most part?
My top &quot;problems&quot;, in some shape or form, from existing products:
- Be faster to complete builds
- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)
- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)
- Don&#x27;t be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical &#x27;test&#x27; across Playwright and Cypress)
- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)
- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification
What do the HN folks think?

This is an essay describing a basic sanity-inducing mental movement that I use approximately ten times per week, and suspect other people would benefit from adopting (and regularly reminding each other to do). I&#x27;ve talked about it elsewhere, but until now it didn&#x27;t have its own linkable reference post.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">About a year ago, I wrote about how to bundle ES modules with rollup.js. One thing I didn’t talk about was how to create multiple file formats from your bundle.
For example, let’s say you have a JS library that you want to distribute in a browser-ready format (an IIFE or revealing module pattern), as well as a single file with ES module exports, and another for use with Node.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Not only my first step, but what&#x27;s the path which I should follow in order to become good at designing my own UI/UX for my products?
I am currently a full stack web developer, and I mostly use templates / pre-made components when working on projects, but I want to start doing my own custom designs.
I am sure that I need to learn the basics of UI/UX design first, then move to a tool such as Figma / XD / Sketch.
But the number of resources online is just too much, I can&#x27;t weed out the bad ones, and I can&#x27;t figure out a clear roadmap for myself on how to appraoch my journey?
Your input on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

            >Ask HN: Is GitHub&#x27;s &quot;Contribute Compare&quot; UI/UX on the Way Out?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It used to be fairly easy to find an entry point into that most-helpful UI in one of &quot;my repositories&quot;, or that of a third-party, by selecting a non-main branch at the top-level of a repo&#x27;s GitHub Web UI, then clicking the Contribute dropdown on the far-right of that element, and then clicking Compare.
From there, one could play with the base and compare dropdowns.
Of late, I find it&#x27;s completely hit-or-miss, regardless of the browser, and regardless of that browser&#x27;s regular vs. private mode (if it has that distinction).
Anyone else experienced similar? I&#x27;ve found it quite disruptive the past several days, but maybe it&#x27;s just me?

The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the

historic by the IETF. Its usage in Chrome has declined significantly over the
recent year. Consequently it is
removed as of Chrome

            >Ask HN: What are the fundamental diffs between modern web vs. desktop UI models</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -&gt; HTML5 -&gt; JS -&gt; Node -&gt; React -&gt; [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.
As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There&#x27;s almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, &quot;classic&quot; MVC, etc.)
So I&#x27;m asking without (much) predjudice: what&#x27;s so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I&#x27;m just not seeing them?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">There was a time when liberal ideals of self-determination, self-regulation, and free-range independence naturally extended to parenting as well. Such ideals were seen in stark opposition to conservative parenting based on obedience, discipline, and reverence. Today it seems like these roles are often reversed.
The strictest parents I have encountered since we had kids a decade ago are those who&#x27;d be flattered to be called hippies. They&#x27;re not obsessed with honoring god or country, like the old authoritarians (though they have their own cultural religions), but they&#x27;re just as keen to shield their kids from the devils of the day. Be that screen time or sugar or other moral or bodily corruptions.
In fact, the appeal of purity somehow seems even stronger with this modern authoritarian crowd.…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It is no secret that motivation can be hard to come by. And when you do find it, it seems like the most insignificant things can take away all of your drive. But fear not - there are many ways to increase your motivation levels and keep them high all day long.


In this article, I will explore ways to keep motivation high and bounce back from setbacks; these methods are psychology-proven to work in any situation. Let&#x27;s dive deep into this topic. 


Consider Your Reason(s) Why 


One of the best ways to motivate yourself is by considering your &quot;why.&quot; What do we mean by that? Think about why you want to achieve a certain goal. &quot;But, what if I don&#x27;t know why?&quot; you might ask.


Well, there&#x27;s a way for you to find your motivation and discover your true &quot;why.&quot;

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been publishing on my blog since 2006 - something I&#x27;m personally proud of. My blog is the personal little space I&#x27;ve carved for myself on the web. Whilst I&#x27;m here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I&#x27;ve managed. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of &quot;easy goals&quot; - something that&#x27;s achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they&#x27;re wiped clean from my own memory.

The difference between the right tool and the wrong one is time, money and safety. The satisfaction of having an appropriate lever for your effort is extraordinary.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 11, 2021 3:58 PM GMT

Container logistics is an interesting but complicated topic, with a lot of implicit knowledge kept by industry insiders. In this post, I&#x27;ll give a brief overview, based on my experiences having worked in the industry for three different shipping companies (all located in Chile) over a period of five years. Hopefully, this will allow people to get more accurate models of the heavy port congestion in Long Beach that has been theorized about extensively here on LW. I can&#x27;t comment on circumstances specific to that port or the US more generally; but there&#x27;s a set of underlying intuitions that should give people a solid, universal foundation to think about the issue. Based on those intuitions, I think people are way too optimistic about simple and eas…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">(If you prefer watching over reading, this article is also available as a video.)
  

From raster to vector #
Have you ever scaled an image and the result was pixelated and unsatisfactory? If
so, you have probably dealt with a raster image format such as WebP, PNG, or JPG.
          
  
    Scaling up a raster image makes it look pixelated.
  

In contrast, vector graphics are images that are defined by points in a coordinate system. These
points are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have an
advantage over raster graphics in that they may be scaled up or down to any resolution
without pixelation.
          
  
    Scaling up a vector image with no loss of quality.

            >Distracting? Is it?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a &quot;That&#x27;s distracting&quot; comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it — or feel it — about something you&#x27;re designing.

What&#x27;s distracting about it? Maybe something&#x27;s too colorful. Maybe it&#x27;s something regarding the layout. Maybe it&#x27;s the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it&#x27;s a specific animation. Maybe it&#x27;s even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture.
So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you&#x27;re staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it&#x27;s common to narrow your focus until only the  offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says &quot;it&#x27;s this t…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the biggest environmental issues we are facing today is climate change. It has an impact on every aspect of our lives, including our health and wellbeing. Recycling means fewer raw materials are required to make items, which helps reduce our carbon footprint and our contribution to climate change. A new study by packaging experts RAJA UK has uncovered just how much waste is not being recycled, and as a result, ends up in our ecosystem. Here are just a few of the ways not recycling or reusing items is having a direct impact on both our health and the world around us.

            >Ask HN: Is there money in a powerful graphics/UI lib for embedded systems?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A friend has developed a very powerful and richly featured library for embedded systems UI/graphics.
He does it as a hobby at the moment.
He and I have been wondering if there&#x27;s a viable path to make money with it.
Is there anyone here who has an opinion to share?

            >Ask HN: Why is the Spotify UX so horrible?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few questions for anyone at Spotify:
- Why isn&#x27;t there a list of new episodes from podcasts you follow? (This should be MVP- absolutely every other podcast service i know of has this!)
- How exactly am I supposed to use the &quot;your episodes&quot; playlist?
- Why don&#x27;t podcasts always sort correctly when you go to a podcast list? 
- Why can&#x27;t I search within an artist&#x27;s page? even if it&#x27;s limited to their discography?
- Why can&#x27;t there be a separate list item in the sidebar for podcasts, artists and albums?
- Why can&#x27;t I get to the &quot;find podcasts&quot; area from the library (or the your episodes area)? this used to exist!
- in the podcasts section in your library, why can&#x27;t I sort by most recently updated?
I get why Spotify is pushing podcasts so hard, but why not implement some absolutely basic features?
Phone issues:
- Why does it take so long (if it even shows up) for downloaded podcasts to show up when you&#x27;re offline?
    - what&#x27;s the point of downloading them if they won&#x27;t show up?!?!?!?!?!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The way to work without regrets is to pursue projects that&#x27;ll have been worth your time even if they don&#x27;t pan out. Projects that&#x27;ll tickle your curiosity, flex your competency, and teach you something new regardless of where they ultimately end up. Projects that leave you better off, as a person, despite not being a commercial or critical success. If you work on projects like this, it&#x27;s impossible to waste your time.
My personal nightmare is investing years of my life into something that ends up going nowhere, and then feeling like it was all for nothing. That&#x27;s how life slips through your fingers. That&#x27;s how you cross over from your 20s to your 30s and curse what you missed along the way because the bet didn&#x27;t pay out.
When you look for projects that&#x27;ll be worth it even if they don&#x27;t work, you know you&#x27;ll engage the fires of intrinsic motivation. Tap into the magic of flow. Look with satisfaction at a good day&#x27;s work, well before you&#x27;re done.
That&#x27;s a work of meaning.</p>

This post is the first in a series of transcribed Discord conversations between Richard Ngo and Eliezer Yudkowsky, moderated by Nate Soares. We&#x27;ve also added Richard and Nate&#x27;s running summaries of the conversation (and others&#x27; replies) from Google Docs.
Later conversation participants include Ajeya Cotra, Beth Barnes, Carl Shulman, Holden Karnofsky, Jaan Tallinn, Paul Christiano, Rob Bensinger, and Rohin Shah.
The transcripts are a complete record of several Discord channels MIRI made for discussion. We tried to edit the transcripts as little as possible, other than to fix typos and a handful of confusingly-worded sentences, to add some paragraph breaks, and to add referenced figures and links.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’ve been reading the excellent Design For Safety by Eva PenzeyMoog. There was a line that really stood out to me:
The idea that it’s alright to do whatever unethical thing is currently the industry norm is widespread in tech, and dangerous.
It stood out to me because I had been thinking about certain practices that are widespread, accepted, and yet strike me as deeply problematic. These practices involve tracking users.
The first problem is that even the terminology I’m using would be rejected. When you track users on your website, it’s called analytics. Or maybe it’s stats. If you track users on a large enough scale, I guess you get to just call it data.
Those words—“analytics”, “stats”, and “data”—are often used when the more accurate word would be “tracking.”
Or to put it another way; …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Mary Dyson produces nitty gritty research on the long-accepted notion that shorter line lengths are more legible than longer ones. The study finds that shorter lines do not necessarily lead to faster reading. If you’re looking for a definitive answer …

The manifest id property lets you specify a unique ID for
your PWA.
The protocol_handlers property allows you to

The priority hints origin trial allows you to specify
priority hints for downloading resources.
You can force the Chrome version to 100 to test how your code
will react to a three digit version number.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Can you tell how your day’s gonna go by your mood in the morning?


I sure can!


If I find myself in a negative mood early in the morning, it’s almost as though I should just crawl back in bed and say, “You know what, I’ll try again tomorrow.”


It’s funny but also very serious. The mindset we have first thing in the morning is likely to be carried with us throughout the day. Unless we put forth a major amount of effort to change, which is incredibly hard as anyone who has been in the depths of a bad mood knows. 


Understanding how important our mood is in the morning can either be empowering or terrifying depending on your perspective. 


If you hold onto the idea that you cannot control your emotions and the mood you’re in, then you’ll be waking up each day in hopes that today will be …</p>

I wanted an easy way to test each of these services, so I built the Eleventy API Explorer. Check it out:
https://api-explorer.11ty.dev/
Test out the API Explorer for my last blog post.
And the suite of services have finally found a real home on the Eleventy documentation, too:
https://www.11ty.dev/docs/api-services/
Marginally related, this is a great small example of a project that runs entirely through Eleventy Serverless.
Everything runs through the main index.njk template. Check out the full source code on GitHub.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I work a four-day week now.
It started with the first lockdown. Actually, for a while there, I was working just two days a week while we took a “wait and see” attitude at Clearleft to see how The Situation was going to affect work. We weathered that storm, but rather than going back to a full five-day week I decided to try switching to four days instead.
This meant taking a pay cut. Time is literally money when it comes to work. But I decided it was worth it. That’s a privileged position to be in, I know. I managed to pay off the mortgage on our home last year so that reduced some financial pressure. But I also turned fifty, which made me think that I should really be padding some kind of theoretical nest egg. Still, the opportunity to reduce working hours looked good to me.

Most users should not run into any workflow-breaking changes with this release. If you run custom Lighthouse audits or use tools that depend on details deep in the Lighthouse report JSON, there may be some breaking changes in 9.0 that you need to be aware of.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the most common questions I hear from my students as they transition from beginner to mid-level developers is, “How do you structure code?”
As a code base grows, it can become harder to manage, maintain, and grow. Files become long and unruly. Code snippets get reused in multiple places, so your find yourself copying-and-pasting a lot. As the amount of code grows, your site or app starts to get a little slower.</p>

I don&#x27;t understand what to do when it comes to building UI components that make sense visually, are halfway-decent for UX (especially first time) and are visually pleasing.
Any resources for help? Anything you guys use? An easily scroll-able and search-able site that has CSS/HTML tricks that look neat?
Reading resources also welcome - I doubt any book would get me out of the slump of working for 5 hours on an image gallery that should take 30 minutes.

Mail.ru is one of the leading e-mail services on the Russian-speaking Internet and is in the top 5 sites in Russia in terms of traffic. Mail.ru is an important resource for many people. It receives several hundred million visits per month, and is a portal from where people can access email, news, social media, performance internet searches and more.
Mail.ru wanted to provide its visitors with a high quality user experience, so work began to improve Core Web Vitals. Before discussing our optimization strategy, a few technical details of the Mail.ru home page should first be noted.
Though the project had long been developed using our in-house templating engine Fest, we began to migrate to Svelte 3 in 2019.

I’m super excited about what this can unlock:
Did someone else write a Nunjucks plugin you want to use? But you only use Liquid templates? Yes.
Do you have a Vue component for your navigation but use Nunjucks for everything else? Yes.
Do you want to render some of your template as Markdown? Yes.
This was also one of the most-upvoted/requested features on our enhancement backlog, opened June 2018 with ×54 👍’s.

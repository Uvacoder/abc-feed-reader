          <p>In 1995, I got my first PC with Windows 95 and my first web browser, unbeknownst to me at the time, was Internet Explorer 1.0. I dialed my computer into AOL checked my mail, checked my favorite chat rooms, but I soon learned the Internet I wanted existed outside the in-app silo of America Online. I wanted to surf and create content on the information super highway. Through Angelfire and AOL Pages, I stayed up late creating my own worlds on the World Wide Web.
In 1998, I went to college and was peer pressured to use Netscape by my roommates. Netscape had an exciting atmosphere about it, and its move to open source turned fellow Computer Science nerds into gleeful converts. That move to open source would be a critical change in the life of Netscape but also in the life of the Web and in the …</p>

          <p>Hi HN! Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.
We first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.
We tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an  tag
We made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.
Even now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.
So we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!
You can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

While it may not be fun to have things from your childhood be called “retro,” these designs certainly bring some fond memories. These bold colors and wavy lines make us feel all kinds of feelings.
The retro design style creates a sense of familiarity and connection with viewers that can only be described as the feeling of nostalgia. There is no one age or decade associated with “retro” designs since designers usually aim to target audiences who grew up with them.
And because almost everything modern is a well-forgotten “something” from the past, retro designs appeal to young and old audiences alike.
Retro branding with a modern flair is certainly on the rebound. Don’t miss the VW bus and get on board with this design trend! ■

          <p>We’ve all experienced the frustration of having a great design idea, but not quite being able to translate it into the finished product. When design and development teams are not aligned, it becomes increasingly difficult to bring your design vision to life—impossible even.
This is why design systems are so important for your business. With a design system, you can achieve consistent branding across all digital assets and products. These systems forge a link between the creative expertise of the design team and the more technical proficiency of the developers, ensuring that all projects are executed to the same high degree of success. To put it simply, a great design system is key to a great finished asset.

          <p>Last week I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day in Amsterdam. It was my first time attending the conference (which, this year, was actually two days), but I’m quite sure it won’t be the last. The incredible mix of speakers and attendees with an overwhelming passion for CSS blew me away, and every talk demonstrated in-depth knowledge in the speaker’s chosen area.
With so many insightful talks it’s hard to choose a favourite, but some highlights include Bramus’s deep dive into the cascade (and Cascade Layers), Amit’s guide to creating keyframe animations and Rachel’s insights into how browsers are working together to ship new CSS features interoperably, with Interop 2022.

# Capture double-click and right-click events in the Recorder panel
The Recorder panel can now capture double-click and right-click events.
In this example, start a recording and try to perform the following steps:
Double-click the card to enlarge it
Right-click the card and select an action from the context menu
To understand how Recorder captured these events, expand the steps:
Double-click is captured as type: doubleClick.
Right-click event is captured as type: click but with the button property is set to secondary. The button value of a normal mouse click is primary.

This is useful when you want to use the same input source JavaScript code to run in both a server context and a client context, without making huge modifications to the code!
Practically speaking, I used this in a couple places to implement the SSR examples for .
The transformations are mapped using standard import maps objects and the package can run as an ES module (via import) or in CommonJS (via require).
Usage #
Pass in a source code string and an import maps object.
// Import the ES Module:
import { ImportTransformer } from &quot;esm-import-transformer&quot;;
// or use with CommonJS:
// const { ImportTransformer } &#x3D; require(&quot;esm-import-transformer&quot;);
let it &#x3D; new ImportTransformer();
let inputCode &#x3D; &#x60;import {html, css, LitElement} from &quot;lit&quot;;&#x60;;
let importMap &#x3D; {
  imports: {
    lit: &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lit/dist@2/core/lit-core.min.js&quot;
  }
};
let outputCode &#x3D; it.transform(sourceCode, importMap);
Installation #
Available on npm and GitHub
npm install esm-import-transformer</p>

          <p>Hi HN, Peter here, founder of Karate Labs (https://karatelabs.io) joined by my co-founder Kapil. Karate is an open-source solution unifying API and UI test automation, including mock servers and performance testing (https://github.com/karatelabs/karate).
Back in 2016, I was part of the API platform team at Intuit. An issue had been slowing down the team: a particular test for a set of key services would randomly fail, and it was not clear if this was a problem with the test or if there was a genuine defect. The deeper I looked, the more the complexity around the test-suite freaked me out. It was using an in-house framework, which had evolved over years and the test depended on code in multiple files scattered across the workspace. It was clear that many programmers had attempted to fix it …</p>

          <p>Hey folks! I am starting a new job and I basically know 0 about the technology I going to deal with. I know the language (Rust) but not the context I am working in. It’s a fairly new tech stack and the position is Senior/remote. I will have an onboarding buddy though.
I will have to dig through a large codbase, and the codebase of the framework we are using.  Besides that, the business part is also completely new to me.
I wonder: What are your tools and habits you use to accomplish something, store gained knowledge, dig through codebases etc.

          <p>Feels like every company I&#x27;ve seen has a different process, and always all over the place. I see hard to understand diagrams in various places, sometimes even outdated. I also see data models all over the place between services, sometimes held inside an excel sheet. Also there&#x27;s no standardized system that people actually use (Like UML but I rarely seen it used.) Maybe I&#x27;m just at the wrong companies and other companies have it all figured out?

          <p>I&#x27;m currently working on a side-project that, for a change, I&#x27;d like to fully structure first before diving into the code.
I know there are specific UI/UX tools, like Framer, Adobe XD and Sketch. There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.
What I&#x27;m looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to &#x27;zoom in&#x27; on specific layers for more detail.
Is there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that&#x27;s not made for it but works well?

          <p>I&#x27;ve run my blog for 21 years. I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I&#x27;ve been polishing it up recently to get back into it.
It used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but people knew what to do with it. I&#x27;ve maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?
Firefox used to offer subscription options but I don&#x27;t see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.
In the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I&#x27;m writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?
I&#x27;ve been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on. Feeling pretty old right now.

          <p>Hey,
this is number 300 of my article recommendation summaries. It’s crazy to see where this project is now compared to when I started: I always read a lot of resources and missed some sort of summary. Back then, I was blogging more often myself and so I just published my first summary on my blog. Quickly after, I realized that this makes more sense for many people to get it via email and I started using TinyLetter for my first 12 subscribers.

“Confuse them, then rescue them. This is how thought leadership works.”
You’ve almost certainly heard of JavaScript Component Frameworks (Libraries 🌶) like Vue.js, Preact, Svelte, Lit, SolidJS, and others.
This is not to be confused with JavaScript Application Frameworks like NuxtJS, Next.js, Gatsby, Remix, Astro, SvelteKit and others.
Well, huh—where does Vite live?
Application frameworks typically make use of one (or more! hi Astro) component frameworks.
Now folks that spend their time in the wonderful world of frameworks have likely encountered the term “Server-Side Rendering” (often abbreviated as SSR). What they might not be familiar with is that SSR …</p>

          <p>In episode #37 of the podcast, we talked with professional poker player Annie Duke about thinking in probabilities, something good poker players do all the time.

          <p>The mobile-first design methodology is great—it focuses on what really matters to the user, it’s well-practiced, and it’s been a common design pattern for years. So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too…right? 
Well, not necessarily. Classic mobile-first CSS development is based on the principle of overwriting style declarations: you begin your CSS with default style declarations, and overwrite and/or add new styles as you add breakpoints with min-width media queries for larger viewports (for a good overview see “What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?”). But all those exceptions create complexity and inefficiency, which in turn can lead to an increased testing effort and a code base that’s harder to maintain. Admit it—how many of us willingly want that?

Installed PWAs can register as file handlers, making it
easy for users to open files directly from disk.
The inert attribute allows you to mark parts of the DOM as inert.
The Navigation API makes it easier for single page apps
to handle navigation and updates to the URL
And there&#x27;s plenty more.

see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 102.
# File Handling API
The File Handling API allows installed PWAs to register with the OS as a file
handler. Once registered, a user can click on a file to open it with the
installed PWA. This is perfect for PWAs that interact with files, for example,
image editors, IDEs, text editors, and so on.
To add file handling functionality to your PWA, you&#x27;ll need to update your

          <p>In the 90&#x27;s, a number of teenagers made Geocities sites, which awakened their interest in web development and taught them some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Many of these teens went on to become web developers.
Later, many teenagers learned these skills as they customized their LiveJournal or MySpace.
Later still, many teenagers learned these skills customizing their Tumblr.
Does Gen Z have anything like this, that is creating a pipeline to web development? I know Tumblr and LiveJournal still exist, but they don&#x27;t seem to be popular with Gen Z at all.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31668201 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do RSS readers handle items missing pubDates?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;m writing an RSS reader, and I noticed that items often miss publication dates. Regardless, other readers seem to be able to gather them anyway, I&#x27;m guessing through the actual site.
Is this generally done through web scraping, archival information, web crawler data, or something else entirely?
I&#x27;m asking because I would hate to resort to those types of methods as they are generally heavy on resources and unstable.

Editors are often unaware of which books are truly profitable. They keep track of cultural impact, literary respect, the idea of a book being ‘well published’ and the hard-to-measure currency […]</p>

          <p>You can now experiment and participate in an origin
trial for Attribution
Reporting. There are a number of available developer resources and code samples
to get started.
To generate summary reports in the origin trial, you&#x27;ll first need to set up
the aggregation service. This blog post gives an overview of those steps.
If you ran an origin trial with this API in 2021, follow the migration
guide
to prepare for the latest origin trial.

Otis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉
A happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-…</p>

          <p>There are so many books and resources titled Design Patterns in X language but all of them seem to be teaching it in a way that aren&#x27;t ideal in a practical situation.
Most of them just look like the language was used like Java style Gang of Four or Head First Design Patterns.
Are there any books that teach design patterns without either relying on a language or using the language specific idioms correctly?

          <p>Hey!
I’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.
This can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is
Measuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.
What are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?

Packaging plays a significant role in selling a product when it is done creatively and correctly. There’s more to promotional products than applying a logo to a box or creating a fancy label. Consumers are attracted to it, and it communicates a message.
In most cases, the packaging is used to protect products. Now packaging design is diverse. Although most packaging is designed to keep products safe, others help brands stand out and entertain customers. It can be why a customer tries a product for the first time.
Whether it’s clean, muted colors or whimsical details that lighten the mood, the designs customers gravitate towards these days show the impact creative packaging has on their buying decisions.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Although Y2K itself was popular between 1995 and 2004, we will focus on designs from the early 2000s. In fact, since looks come into fashion again after about twenty years, we’re right on schedule!
The Y2K looks emphasize technology and futuristic looks, mainly in the form of shiny skin-tight clothes and silver-blue eyeshadow. During this time, technology such as Windows 95, PlayStation, and N64 were at their peak. Pokemon had just been released in Japan and the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys were sweeping the nation. These years played a crucial role in the culture of 30 somethings around the globe.
Missed the first three in this series? We’ve got you covered. Explore 70s, 80s, and 90s design trends here:

          <p>Hi HN,
while building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.
So, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.
The first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.
We are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.
Cheerz :)

WebPageTest has always been great at providing in-depth and accurate information about how your site performs across all major browsers, but we’ve always stopped just short of giving you specific advice on what to do.

          <p>Hello HN! Author here :)
I&#x27;ve finished upgrading the Hacker News reading app that I made sometime earlier.
Among previous features, I added some new ones - which include:
- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later, and   the newly added comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier);
- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in;
- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).
The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it&#x27;s client side rendered.
The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.
Let me know what you think about the app in the comments.
Thanks!

          <p>The last two years have greatly accelerated the transition into hybrid work, but that’s not when remote collaboration started. With a growing reliance on digital tools, many of us have been working together across vast distances for a number of years.

PodRocket podcast (from the folks at 

LogRocket)
We talk to Zach Leatherman, creator and maintainer of Eleventy, about Eleventy, what it was like to be acquired by Netlify, and how Eleventy reached 3 million downloads on npm.
Although I wouldn’t say “acquired” is the right term—Netlify is sponsoring Eleventy 😅

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31562460 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are JS bundlers filling a design flaw?</a>
          <p>I don’t have a lot of experience in Node development. From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.
From looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.
Shouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?
These things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31563325 target="_blank">Ask HN: How often are you operating at 100% productivity/motivation?</a>
          <p>Sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like working. Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn&#x27;t have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.
How do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?
Maybe it&#x27;s just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.
I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.

          <p>I enjoyed this article by Jeremy Keith on writing alt text for images. In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an . It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).
As a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.

          <p>How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?
Examples of experiments:
 - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.
 - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.
 - Try intermittent fasting.
 - Start writing tests first (TDD).
I wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the &quot;scientific method&quot; on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.

          <p>Mine: overlay on video (especially when they&#x27;re not full screened).
They&#x27;re often too obstructive for no reason (often has a too large dark gradient that blocks bottom or top of the video), takes forever to disappear, and hard to operate (very easy to accidentally pause the video). For example, CC button for YouTube: it totally could be below the video element.
This is especially annoying on mobile since there is not keyboard shortcuts.

The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.
The side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem.

          <p>I know I’m not alone in browsing hacker news on my phone.
On mobile devices the flag/hide buttons are super close to the article and comment links. I hit them all the time unintentionally.
Maybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?
I have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.

Chrome 103 beta was released on May 26, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late June, 2022.
# Block external protocol in sandboxed iframes
Sandboxed iframes are not blocked from opening external applications. Currently, developers sandbox untrusted content and block user navigation. Blocking probably should have also included links to external apps or to the Play store. This has now been fixed.
Sites that need navigation can add the following values to the  element&#x27;s sandbox property:
allow-popups
allow-top-navigation
allow-top-navigation-with-user-activation

          <p>CHIPS is a Privacy
Sandbox proposal that introduces a mechanism to opt-in to having third-party
cookies partitioned by top-level site using a new cookie attribute,
Partitioned.
The experiment started in Chrome 100 on March 29, 2022 and was scheduled to run
until June 14, 2022.
To give developers more time to test the feature and gather more feedback, an
extension to the experiment will run through Chrome 104 until the release of Chrome 105, on August 30, 2022.
Starting in version 103, Chrome will include an alternative CHIPS origin trial design for HTTP
cookies, which should enable an opt-in mechanism that will make deployment
easier for large organizations.
In the new design, sending Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Partitioned-Cookies header will
no longer be required to enroll in the origin trial. Sites will only need to
send the Origin-Trial header with their CHIPS origin trial token when they are sending
responses that include the Set-Cookie header with the Partitioned
attribute.
To enroll in the origin trial and start experimenting, head over to
CHIPS origin trial instructions.</p>

Tamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.
All of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.
I think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a &#x60;size&#x60; prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.

          <p>There are tons of conflicting opinions on the best approach to architecting and designing large scale software. I&#x27;d love to hear some anecdotes for what&#x27;s really worked in the real world.
Bonus points if the pattern was used in a large scale web app with multiple clients and a common backend api.

          <p>I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?
Obviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.
To test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase &quot;survey&quot; engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.
Love to hear your thoughts and feedback: https://tuun.app/
Best,

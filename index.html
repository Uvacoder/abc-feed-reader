          <p>I wondered if the people of HN could critique my blog design.
It&#x27;s here: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog2/
The version it is meant to replace is at https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/ - the new version is meant to be less cluttered and less ugly, and honour a dark mode preference.
I&#x27;d like to know whether the new version is actually an improvement, whether you think it looks ugly, whether you think it is too hard to read, and what improvements you would suggest.
Cheers!

          <p>It goes without saying that supporting Dribbble means supporting a diverse and inclusive community of designers all over the world, all year round. This month in particular, we’re proud to not only spotlight some incredibly talented LGBTQIA+ artists and designers, but also invite them to shed light on the immense impact that art and design can have on amplifying queer voices.
Why is it essential to support and uplift the LGBTQIA+ community through art and design?

 I’m Elly Ayling, a designer and freelance illustrator based in Ottawa, Ontario! By day I work in non-profit to help advocate for underserved communities and fund grassroots organizations that uplift them. Outside my MacBook screen, I’m usually tweeting about TV, baking something citrusy, or reading cheesy horror.

          <p>This article was written by Bunny Tharpe, Vice President of Marketing at Quark Software, Inc.—the global provider of content design, automation, and intelligence software.
I’m a journalism school graduate and proud “word freak” who’s worked in marketing for 30 years. But as clever as my words might be, I know they could be ignored if not for the right packaging. Thankfully, I’ve worked with some amazing graphic designers and art directors throughout my career and enjoy collaborating with them to bring content to life—from a brochure or annual report to an email campaign or entire website.
I have even more respect and appreciation for graphic designers now that I run marketing for the software company that revolutionized professional desktop publishing. During the last year, I’ve learned a …</p>

          <p># What is Early Hints?
Websites have become more sophisticated over time. As such, it&#x27;s not unusual that a server needs to perform non-trivial work (for example, access to databases, or CDNs accessing the origin server) to produce the HTML for the requested page. Unfortunately, this &quot;server think-time&quot; results in extra latency before the browser can start rendering the page. Indeed, the connection effectively goes idle for as long as it takes the server to prepare the response.
Without Early Hints: everything is blocked on the server determining how to respond for the main resource.

Early Hints is an HTTP status code (103 Early Hints) used to send a preliminary HTTP response ahead of a final response. This allows a server to send hints to the browser about critical sub-resources (for exam…</p>

# Block third-party contexts navigating to filesystem URLs
iframes can no longer navigate to filesystem URLs. Top frame support for navigating to filesystem URLs was dropped in Chrome 68.
# Remove non-standard client hint mode
Four client hints (dpr, width, viewport-width, and device-memory) have a default allowlist of self but behave as though they have a default allowlist of * on Android, contrary to the spec. This is now fixed, increasing privacy on Android by requiring explicit delegation of these hints.

          <p>I&#x27;m taking on a new client for my consulting business and I&#x27;m reiterating the need for close working on domain understanding, and therefore domain driven design.
I like the principles but not the details and was wondering if HN had any thoughts/tips when using (or not using) DDD?

          <p>Please, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love the simplicity of HN. But I feel like many threads get abandoned by their parents because there is no indicator to let them know someone has engaged in conversation. A simple reddit-style &quot;orangered&quot; would fix that. Nothing more - just that.

          <p>I’m 100% convinced that working demo-to-demo is the secret formula to making successful creative products.
Video games have a strong history of ritualizing prototypes, play testing, and following the fun. There’s even some data that suggests prototypes increase your chances of success.
Mentioned in Creativity, Inc and exemplified in the Frozen II documentary Into the Unknown, Pixar and Disney Animation use “dailies” to demo work in progress. Each animator shares their progress every day on the five seconds of film they’re responsible for.
Outlined in Ken Kocienda’s book Creative Selection, Apple’s clandestine “Project Purple” that made the iPhone embraced frequent demos when creating iOS, but at the speed at which they were working “hallway demos” would happen hours or minutes after a prev…</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31827449 target="_blank">Ask HN: I struggle to hire a UI/UX designer, can anyone help?</a>
          <p>For the past 2 months I&#x27;ve been struggling to hire a web designer to create a website for me. I wrote the entire product specification, all screens and app flows, and I want a designer to take that spec and turn it into a real product design.
Attempt #1: Direct hire
Posted a local job and hired a person based on their portfolio. We signed the contract, and they started the project. 2 weeks later I check in and all they have done is the color palette and fonts. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m unreasonable when I say this is way too little work for 2 weeks booked at 8 hours / day. I closed the contract afterwards and I consider I simply got scammed. Am I being unreasonable here?
Attempt #2: Upwork
I posted my project on Upwork for a fixed price, estimated at 300 hours and with a price per hour that matches what Upwork says is their &quot;top freelancers&quot;. I received more than 100 applications in the first 3 hours. Looking at their past work and portfolio, I notice a lot of them have linked the same projects, with the same screenshots and project description. I closed the project after I saw that, fearing another scam.
Attempt #3: LinkedIn
Posted a job for a contract-based short term project. I received less than 20 applicants in a week, and most of them sent me 5 page CVs without a portfolio. The portfolios that I got from the rest of them were very slim, presenting 1-2 project mockups which could barely be called projects, even though they called themselves experienced professionals.
I&#x27;m currently out of ideas on what to try next. I&#x27;m willing to pay top money for top work, and I mentioned this in every job ad, but for some reason all I get is scam attempts or homework projects.
Do you have some advice on how to hire high quality designers? Is there something wrong that I&#x27;m doing here?

      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Whether the rejection is the result of a job application, cold outreach, concept pitch, or just negative feedback, being turned down still hurts.
The self-worth of creative professionals is often tied to producing great content and products. In this case, rejection can be even more painful. It is impossible to avoid rejection entirely, but there are strategies and techniques to cope with it and sometimes utilize it as a creative advantage.
Here are five different strategies for handling rejection and even how you can turn an unpleasant experience into a positive one!

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
There&#x27;s a new HTTP 103 status code that helps the browser
decide what content to preload before the page has even started to arrive.
The Local Font Access API gives web applications the ability
to enumerate and use fonts installed on the user&#x27;s computer.
AbortSignal.timeout() is an easier way to implement
timeouts on asynchronous APIs.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 103.
# HTTP 103 status code 103 - early hints
One way you can improve page performance is to use resource hints. They give
the browser &quot;hints&quot; about what stuff it might need later. For example,
preloading files, or connecting to a different server.

But when something is to happen at the exact moment because other things depend on it, you quickly learn timers are more of a problem than a solution. They are never on time, really. Web Animations API could eliminate the need for timers in certain cases while being precise.</p>

As I’ve been away from Twitter and have only encountered this link via my RSS application, I’ve taken it upon myself to contact Feedbin support to correct what must be an error in their typically inerrant feed reading application experience.
I have not yet clicked through to your web blog out of concern for my own cybersecurity. I suspect that I am being targeted for an elaborate phishing attack. No one will be jacking my clicks, I can assure you of that.
If not a nation-state level cyber-attack: might this be yet another instance of a Richard Revolution video trolling?
Or perhaps you’ve simply let your domain name renewal lapse. Has the technology behind domain parking pages advanced to a never before seen level of individualized personalization? Is this a marketing ploy by GoDaddy on this the most sacred of company holidays: GoFather’s Day?
Please contact me through the usual second-factor back-channels to ensure that everything is—as GitHub status tweets casually and confidently repeat—operating normally.
Until then I’m afraid the link will remain unapologetically and skeptically :not(:visited).
Kind domain shards,
Zach</p>

          <p>Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s an initiative against &quot;shrinkflation&quot;, to avoid situations where the busy crowd is tricked by corporate tricks.
The system should allow price changes, but only honest ones.
Should we have sets of fixed package weights and volumes for food and beverages? VAT penalties for odd form factors? Or something else?

          <p>For example, in the input field the user enters the raw value as so:
[123456789]
And the formatted equivalent would be:
123,456,789
What is a good UX pattern for showing the user the thousands separators?
I&#x27;ve seen some forms where the commas / spaces are dynamically inserted in the input field (but then users end up trying to type in the commas / spaces manually).
We currently display a formatted preview of the raw input directly next to the input field (and this preview is refreshed onkeyup).
Just wondering what other good UX patterns you&#x27;ve seen that cater for this?
Thanks ^_^

          <p>My co-founder and I met while working for a company in the geospatial space. I was a product manager there, and he was an Ui/Ux designer. We worked closely on a number of projects during that time. We don&#x27;t have any special connection, but we both love the design side of things.
Looking at the design space, we discovered that there are some major issues that people face when trying to find designers for their projects -
A significant amount of time is wasted searching on Upwork and Fiverr for a qualified designer.
Most agencies screw their clients, and they are also expensive.
Billable hours for design services are not justified, causing budgets to skyrocket in most cases.
As a result, we are launching - Design Point
Consider it the Netflix of Ui/Ux design.
A monthly / yearly subscription fee will be charged.
What will you receive?
Design requests are unlimited.
Unlimited feedback modifications.
An infinite number of team members.

          <p>I&#x27;m very good at CSS but I despise writing 1000s lines of code, one page can easily get 500 lines+. I really wish there were programs that could output good UI code, ie. Adobe XD to proper Html/CSS
but I&#x27;ve not found any.
So I tried using just UI frameworks like Bootstrap, however, but learning curve was bigger and every page looked the same. (And don&#x27;t suggest tailwind)
Maybe there is outsourced service to whom I can give designs and get html/css back for very low cost like $10-20 per page. I tried one at fiver and it was far from pixel perfect and wasn&#x27;t mobile responsive.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been wondering if Magic Trackpad adds any value to my workflow. I use my MBP in two ways:
(0) clamshell mode when connected to an external display;
(1) as a laptop.
If (0) is the case, I use mouse and keyboard but sometimes I miss the fact that I can just scroll quickly on the MBP&#x27;s Trackpad. However, pressing on the Trackpad for long hours isn&#x27;t fun either as my fingers get tired.

I dialed my computer into AOL checked my mail, checked my favorite chat rooms, but I soon learned the Internet I wanted existed outside the in-app silo of America Online. I wanted to surf and create content on the information super highway. Through Angelfire and AOL Pages, I stayed up late creating my own worlds on the World Wide Web.
In 1998, I went to college and was peer pressured to use Netscape by my roommates. Netscape had an exciting atmosphere about it, and its move to open source turned fellow Computer Science nerds into gleeful converts. That move to open source would be a critical change in the life of Netscape but also in the life of the Web and in the …</p>

          <p>Hi HN! Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.
We first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.
We tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an  tag
We made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.
Even now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.
So we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!
You can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

While it may not be fun to have things from your childhood be called “retro,” these designs certainly bring some fond memories. These bold colors and wavy lines make us feel all kinds of feelings.
The retro design style creates a sense of familiarity and connection with viewers that can only be described as the feeling of nostalgia. There is no one age or decade associated with “retro” designs since designers usually aim to target audiences who grew up with them.
And because almost everything modern is a well-forgotten “something” from the past, retro designs appeal to young and old audiences alike.
Retro branding with a modern flair is certainly on the rebound. Don’t miss the VW bus and get on board with this design trend! ■

This is why design systems are so important for your business. With a design system, you can achieve consistent branding across all digital assets and products. These systems forge a link between the creative expertise of the design team and the more technical proficiency of the developers, ensuring that all projects are executed to the same high degree of success. To put it simply, a great design system is key to a great finished asset.

You could go out for a fancy dinner with friends, or you could buy one share of Google at their IPO. A couple of decades later, your dinner is forgotten but […]</p>

          <p>Last week I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day in Amsterdam. It was my first time attending the conference (which, this year, was actually two days), but I’m quite sure it won’t be the last. The incredible mix of speakers and attendees with an overwhelming passion for CSS blew me away, and every talk demonstrated in-depth knowledge in the speaker’s chosen area.
With so many insightful talks it’s hard to choose a favourite, but some highlights include Bramus’s deep dive into the cascade (and Cascade Layers), Amit’s guide to creating keyframe animations and Rachel’s insights into how browsers are working together to ship new CSS features interoperably, with Interop 2022.
On Day 1, Lea gave an incredible presentation (on CSS variables) that blew everyone’s minds with what CSS can be capable of…</p>

# Capture double-click and right-click events in the Recorder panel
The Recorder panel can now capture double-click and right-click events.
In this example, start a recording and try to perform the following steps:
Double-click the card to enlarge it
Right-click the card and select an action from the context menu
To understand how Recorder captured these events, expand the steps:
Double-click is captured as type: doubleClick.
Right-click event is captured as type: click but with the button property is set to secondary. The button value of a normal mouse click is primary.

// Before
import {html, css, LitElement} from &quot;lit&quot;;
// After
import {html, css, LitElement} from &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lit/dist@2/core/lit-core.min.js&quot;;
Source code on GitHub
This is useful when you want to use the same input source JavaScript code to run in both a server context and a client context, without making huge modifications to the code!
Practically speaking, I used this in a couple places to implement the SSR examples for .
The transformations are mapped using standard import maps objects and the package can run as an ES module (via import) or in CommonJS (via require).
Usage #
Pass in a source code string and an import maps object.
// Import the ES Module:
import { ImportTransformer } from &quot;esm-import-transformer&quot;;
// or use with CommonJS:
// const { ImportTransformer } &#x3D; require(&quot;esm-import-transformer&quot;);
let it &#x3D; new ImportTransformer();
let inputCode &#x3D; &#x60;import {html, css, LitElement} from &quot;lit&quot;;&#x60;;
let importMap &#x3D; {
  imports: {
    lit: &quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lit/dist@2/core/lit-core.min.js&quot;
  }
};
let outputCode &#x3D; it.transform(sourceCode, importMap);

          <p>Hi HN, Peter here, founder of Karate Labs (https://karatelabs.io) joined by my co-founder Kapil. Karate is an open-source solution unifying API and UI test automation, including mock servers and performance testing (https://github.com/karatelabs/karate).
Back in 2016, I was part of the API platform team at Intuit. An issue had been slowing down the team: a particular test for a set of key services would randomly fail, and it was not clear if this was a problem with the test or if there was a genuine defect. The deeper I looked, the more the complexity around the test-suite freaked me out. It was using an in-house framework, which had evolved over years and the test depended on code in multiple files scattered across the workspace. It was clear that many programmers had attempted to fix it …</p>

I will have to dig through a large codbase, and the codebase of the framework we are using.  Besides that, the business part is also completely new to me.
I wonder: What are your tools and habits you use to accomplish something, store gained knowledge, dig through codebases etc.

          <p>In the last couple of years (rather slowed by the pandemic), a number of new browser APIs have started to land that I had wanted over a decade ago. That&#x27;s not to say that the process is slow, more that the technology simply didn&#x27;t exist a 10 years ago, and now the APIs exist, it took me a matter of hours to build the small bit of software I so desperately needed back then.</p>

          <p>Feels like every company I&#x27;ve seen has a different process, and always all over the place. I see hard to understand diagrams in various places, sometimes even outdated. I also see data models all over the place between services, sometimes held inside an excel sheet. Also there&#x27;s no standardized system that people actually use (Like UML but I rarely seen it used.) Maybe I&#x27;m just at the wrong companies and other companies have it all figured out?

          <p>I&#x27;m currently working on a side-project that, for a change, I&#x27;d like to fully structure first before diving into the code.
I know there are specific UI/UX tools, like Framer, Adobe XD and Sketch. There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.
What I&#x27;m looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to &#x27;zoom in&#x27; on specific layers for more detail.
Is there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that&#x27;s not made for it but works well?

          <p>I&#x27;ve run my blog for 21 years. I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I&#x27;ve been polishing it up recently to get back into it.
It used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but people knew what to do with it. I&#x27;ve maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?
Firefox used to offer subscription options but I don&#x27;t see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.
In the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I&#x27;m writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?
I&#x27;ve been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on. Feeling pretty old right now.

          <p>Hey,
this is number 300 of my article recommendation summaries. It’s crazy to see where this project is now compared to when I started: I always read a lot of resources and missed some sort of summary. Back then, I was blogging more often myself and so I just published my first summary on my blog. Quickly after, I realized that this makes more sense for many people to get it via email and I started using TinyLetter for my first 12 subscribers. It grew quickly to about 100 subscribers and then onwards to 500.

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Installed PWAs can register as file handlers, making it
easy for users to open files directly from disk.
The inert attribute allows you to mark parts of the DOM as inert.
The Navigation API makes it easier for single page apps
to handle navigation and updates to the URL
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 102.
# File Handling API
The File Handling API allows installed PWAs to register with the OS as a file
handler. Once registered, a user can click on a file to open it with the
installed PWA. This is perfect for PWAs that interact with files, for example,

          <p>In the 90&#x27;s, a number of teenagers made Geocities sites, which awakened their interest in web development and taught them some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Many of these teens went on to become web developers.
Later, many teenagers learned these skills as they customized their LiveJournal or MySpace.
Later still, many teenagers learned these skills customizing their Tumblr.
Does Gen Z have anything like this, that is creating a pipeline to web development? I know Tumblr and LiveJournal still exist, but they don&#x27;t seem to be popular with Gen Z at all.

          <p>I&#x27;m writing an RSS reader, and I noticed that items often miss publication dates. Regardless, other readers seem to be able to gather them anyway, I&#x27;m guessing through the actual site.
Is this generally done through web scraping, archival information, web crawler data, or something else entirely?
I&#x27;m asking because I would hate to resort to those types of methods as they are generally heavy on resources and unstable.

          <p>May is over already which means the kids are now out of school, summer has begun, and work is ramping up at Luro. Here is the retelling of vibes…

The little league championship 🏆
In my last vibe check I mentioned my son’s little league experience and how he and his teammates talked about the playoffs, but I wasn’t sure if they existed or not. Well… the playoffs were real! A single elimination playoff bracket. Eight teams enter, one team leaves…
Otis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉
A happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-…</p>

Denialism, on the other hand, is a willful rejection of reality. It’s safe and easy, and unproductive. Because there’s no room to change your mind. To be a generous skeptic, […]</p>

          <p>There are so many books and resources titled Design Patterns in X language but all of them seem to be teaching it in a way that aren&#x27;t ideal in a practical situation.
Most of them just look like the language was used like Java style Gang of Four or Head First Design Patterns.
Are there any books that teach design patterns without either relying on a language or using the language specific idioms correctly?

          <p>Hey!
I’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.
This can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is
Measuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.
What are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?

Packaging plays a significant role in selling a product when it is done creatively and correctly. There’s more to promotional products than applying a logo to a box or creating a fancy label. Consumers are attracted to it, and it communicates a message.
In most cases, the packaging is used to protect products. Now packaging design is diverse. Although most packaging is designed to keep products safe, others help brands stand out and entertain customers. It can be why a customer tries a product for the first time.
Whether it’s clean, muted colors or whimsical details that lighten the mood, the designs customers gravitate towards these days show the impact creative packaging has on their buying decisions.
Sustainability by Design: 5 Ways to Greenify Your Packaging

Packaging is an integral part of a product’s branding, and standing out amongst the crowd is not an easy task. We have put together this collection of 12 creative and unique packaging examples to help you get ideas and maybe even inspire your next design.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Although Y2K itself was popular between 1995 and 2004, we will focus on designs from the early 2000s. In fact, since looks come into fashion again after about twenty years, we’re right on schedule!
The Y2K looks emphasize technology and futuristic looks, mainly in the form of shiny skin-tight clothes and silver-blue eyeshadow. During this time, technology such as Windows 95, PlayStation, and N64 were at their peak. Pokemon had just been released in Japan and the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys were sweeping the nation. These years played a crucial role in the culture of 30 somethings around the globe.
Missed the first three in this series? We’ve got you covered. Explore 70s, 80s, and 90s design trends here:

          <p>Hi HN,
while building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.
So, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.
The first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.
We are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.
Cheerz :)

          <p>How would you build a trading system (similar to whatever stock or other exchanges you may use)? I&#x27;m really inspired by coinbase and robin hood, but how they heck are they built?
I am trying to learn more about this but my google searches are not turning up the right results. What is involved on the backend? What systems are in play and how do things work at a high level?

          <p>Today we are excited to launch a set of new, powerful features and functionality for all users of WebPageTest to help make it faster and easier for you and your teams to make sense of your website’s performance, the opportunities for improvement, and, critically, how significant those opportunities are.
WebPageTest has always been great at providing in-depth and accurate information about how your site performs across all major browsers, but we’ve always stopped just short of giving you specific advice on what to do. One of the goals that has guided our changes to WebPageTest in the past few years is to close the gap between “uh oh, something’s wrong” to “I know what I need to do to fix this.”

          <p>Hello HN! Author here :)
I&#x27;ve finished upgrading the Hacker News reading app that I made sometime earlier.
Among previous features, I added some new ones - which include:
- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later, and   the newly added comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier);
- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in;
- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).
The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it&#x27;s client side rendered.
The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.
Let me know what you think about the app in the comments.
Thanks!

That means that if you’ve been struggling to work together over the internet, it might be high time to upgrade your collaboration methods.

We talk to Zach Leatherman, creator and maintainer of Eleventy, about Eleventy, what it was like to be acquired by Netlify, and how Eleventy reached 3 million downloads on npm.
Although I wouldn’t say “acquired” is the right term—Netlify is sponsoring Eleventy 😅

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31562460 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are JS bundlers filling a design flaw?</a>
          <p>I don’t have a lot of experience in Node development. From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.
From looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.
Shouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?
These things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.

          <p>Sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like working. Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn&#x27;t have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.
How do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?
Maybe it&#x27;s just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.
I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.

          <p>I enjoyed this article by Jeremy Keith on writing alt text for images. In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an . It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).
As a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.

          <p>How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?
Examples of experiments:
 - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.
 - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.
 - Try intermittent fasting.
 - Start writing tests first (TDD).
I wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the &quot;scientific method&quot; on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.

          <p>Mine: overlay on video (especially when they&#x27;re not full screened).
They&#x27;re often too obstructive for no reason (often has a too large dark gradient that blocks bottom or top of the video), takes forever to disappear, and hard to operate (very easy to accidentally pause the video). For example, CC button for YouTube: it totally could be below the video element.
This is especially annoying on mobile since there is not keyboard shortcuts.

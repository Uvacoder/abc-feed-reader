          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30928671 target="_blank">Ask HN: How does Apple do UX research?</a>
          <p>It seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma in releasing products &quot;MVP, agile, user-centered design, user studies, etc&quot;.
Yet if these principles are being followed, why does the industry keep pumping low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?
Apple&#x27;s secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.
What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?
Some &quot;more verifiable&quot; sources:

Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.

          <p>Hi all,
My name is Simone Di Nuovo and i&#x27;m the creator of tilepieces, an open source project to visually editing HTML documents and Web applications.
Tilepieces is a software that allows you to create applications for editing HTML documents, using some of the popular interfaces of the browser developer tools (with which it is possible to integrate css edits).
Tilepieces also allows you to reuse your favorite code and libraries, and exposes APIs that are useful for editing multiple files at a time.
You can start using tilepieces with its progressive web application version at https://pwa.tilepieces.net!
I will be happy to receive any comments from you.

          <p>Every once in a while I learn about a JavaScript property that I wish I had known about years earlier — valueAsNumber is one of them. The valueAsNumber provides the value of an input[type&#x3D;number] as a Number type, instead of the traditional string representation when you get the value: /* Assuming an &lt;input type&#x3D;&quot;number&quot; value&#x3D;&quot;1.234&quot; […]

          <p>Screenshot from a Codepen demo. Hovering on a grid item expands the grid tracks.

Somehow it’s already three months since I wrote about the CSS :has() pseudo-class landing in Safari Technology preview. The latest Safari (proper) release has just shipped with support, and can be enabled with a flag in the next Chrome release.
Meanwhile, I’ve been playing around with some ideas on how we can use :has() for styling a gallery or product grid layout. One of the cool things about the selector is that it allows us to not only style a parent element based on any one of its children, but to also style that child’s siblings too. So, building a menu, we could apply some styles to other elements in the menu when one of the links is hovered:
/* Style the list border when link is hovered */

          <p>I booked myself a week off work in late Feb and leading up to that date I started to get (back) into Gameboys. As a kid I grew up with a ZX Spectrum in the home and as a teen I had a Gameboy. I actually managed to use paper-round money to buy myself a pretty nice collection of games, but then for some reason sold it all off - only to then want to re-buy a Gameboy. I wasn&#x27;t so business savvy at that point.
Early on in the year I found that refurbishing Gameboys and modding them wasn&#x27;t too tricky for my own skills and as Feb started to come around two lots on Ebay piqued my interest: one with 8 Gameboys and another with 14. Of the 14, none worked (according to the seller) and of the 8, one worked (a Gameboy Advanced).
After much stress of bidding, I managed to secure the lots, plus purchased…</p>

          <p>There’s a bit of a setup to this song: Big Bird is pouting in his nest, jealous of the new baby Cody which gets a lot of attention. The whole street is concerned about Big Bird. If you ask me, Big Bird is being a bit of a bitch about it all but clearly he’s going through some strong feelings. The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie1 comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.

          <p>Last month I wrote about some of the exciting new CSS features you can expect to see coming to a browser near you in 2022 for Smashing Magazine. It’s certainly an exciting time to be working on the web right now, with browser support for new features moving along at lightning-fast pace! This month saw Safari drop a new release that includes support for a tonne of new stuff, including :has() (A.K.A. the “parent selector”), accent-color, and Cascade Layers (all of which are covered in my Smashing article), as well as some additional gems:
Trigonometric functions
I almost missed this line when skim-reading the Safari release announcement, but yep, Webkit has delivered support for CSS trigonometric functions! I’m unbelievably excited about the possibilities this will open up for creative CSS, …</p>

          <p>Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you&#x27;ve got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn&#x27;t make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.
To make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.
With layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.
Antetype is also build on web concepts: 
That means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).
Video of Antetype&#x27;s features + prototypes built with it:

(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don&#x27;t want to do it yourself.)
I would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.

          <p>I recently realized that certain kinds of knowledge allow one to be significantly more productive when solving a large class of problems.
For example,
* Regular expressions for simple text processing.
* Parser combinators for parsing.
* Parser generators (esp. packrat variety) for parsing.
* The concept of fuzzing and property testing for testing code.
* Calculus for solving all sorts of problems.
* MCMC for solving a huge class of probability problems.
* Search algorithms for solving a variety of problems (e.g. all NP-hard problems, sudoku, HTNs, scheduling, planning).
* Gradient descent for solving a variety of optimization problems.
* Vector Space embedding as a conceptual tool for a variety of complex AI problems.
* Effect composition (Haskell&#x27;s IO or Scala&#x27;s ZIO) as an incredibly powerful paradigm for concurrency and parallelism.
What are some examples of 10x multipliers that come to your mind? Fundamental ideas without which you would be drastically less productive.

Chrome is now at version 100. React just released version 18. It has me thinking that it might be useful to have a standard metric for software that communicates how fast major versions are released.

          <p>What’s the variance in customer service at your organization? Even if there’s just one employee, the question is: If an issue is handled by a committed employee having a good attitude, vs a cranky one who is a bit off–can the customer tell? One philosophy is to make this gap as small as possible. Create […]</p>

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Chrome 100 has a three digit version number
Take a stroll down memory lane and celebrate
#100CoolWebMoments since Chrome&#x27;s first release.
There are some important changes to the user agent string.
The Multi-Screen Window Placement API
makes it possible to enumerate the displays connected to a user&#x27;s machine,
and place windows on specific screens.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 100.
# Chrome 100
When browsers first reached version 10, there were a few
issues as the major version number went from one digit to two. Hopefully,
we learned a few things that&#x27;ll ease the transition from two digits to three.
Chrome 100 is available now, and Firefox 100 ships very soon. These three
digit version number…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/100-web-moments/ target="_blank">Celebrate Chrome 100 with #100CoolWebMoments</a>
          <p>Google Chrome launched in 2018, and in March 2022 we are celebrating the launch of Chrome version 100 with a scroll down memory lane. #100CoolWebMoments remembers some cool, fun, interesting, and important things that have happened in the past 14 years.
A lot has happened on the web since 2018. If you read Ethan Marcotte’s 2010 A List Apart article on responsive web design on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.
Chrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell and Frances Berriman introduced Progressive Web Apps in 2015, with Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser to replace Internet Explorer in the same year.
In March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with Cascade Layers landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.
Tell us which moments you loved the most. If we&#x27;ve missed anything (and we&#x27;re sure we have), tweet us @ChromiumDev with #100CoolWebMoments.</p>

          <p>For as long as developers have written CSS code, we’ve been desperate to have a method to allow styling a parent element based child characteristics. That’s not been possible until now. CSS has introduced the :has pseudo-class which allows styling a parent based on a relative CSS selector! Let’s have a look at a few […]

Of course I have my own thoughts and I&#x27;m going to present them soon in some blog post, but I&#x27;d like to ask what you guys think too.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30817570 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why isn&#x27;t Microsoft good with design consistency?</a>
          <p>With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.
With Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you&#x27;re faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.
This doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I&#x27;d like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they&#x27;re not doing that.
I&#x27;m happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.

          <p>eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

          <p>Recently I started analyzing much more the documents and stylesheets I produce as well as reading more the official CSS and HTML specs. While catering to implementers of user agents, they are generally a goldmine of solid information.
I&#x27;d like also to get inspired by quality work on the web, but inspecting websites pretty much never yields anything that resembles a readable document, HTML semantics and CSS quality are generally in a disastrous state.
Thus my question, can you suggest websites who&#x27;s html and css can be considered of extremely high standards?
I can&#x27;t list many safe for MDN and wikipedia.

          <a href=https://buttmover.com target="_blank">Show HN: Butt Mover, an IRL Productivity and Health Improvement Game</a>
          <p>I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I&#x27;m immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.
Hence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;
1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.
2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.
Those who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.
I&#x27;ve been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.
I hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been looking to increase my use of the keyboard, primarily for the productivity gains that I find myself able to reach by consistently sticking to the keyboard. Since I started though, I&#x27;ve noticed fairly uneven support across applications. For example, reviewing my day&#x27;s worth of meetings and responding to each invitation using Google calendar is very painful to do on the keyboard.
What are people&#x27;s favorite recommendations of keyboard-based productivity tools?

          <p>I&#x27;m browsing with JS and cookies disabled for speed and safety. Lately, more and more simple and plain blogs require JS to show any text on website. Can we just agree on letting basic html do it&#x27;s thing? Why insist on JS to be able to show simple text on webpage?
For example:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30725933
Go ahead, disable JS and try opening blog on this link. Won&#x27;t happen...
This page is simple dark text on white background with some images sprinkled in. Why is JS required to show this?
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in this...

          <p>Lock-in persists. That’s why it’s so valued by monopolists, tyrants and cults. The ability to speak up always creates inefficiency. It’s easier to just shut up and drive. Or be driven. But the ability to speak up is a self-cleaning algorithm. Our freedom to move on, to criticize and to suggest creates the conditions for […]</p>

          <p>You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:
There is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.
It certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.
I hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.

          <p>Hey,

As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts.

      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Millennials rejoice! This one is for you. Are you ready to bring back the loud colors, dive deep into pop culture, wear everything tie-dye, and venture into the raver’s paradise?

          <p># What is CHIPS?
Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox proposal that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
A partitioned third-party cookie is tied to the top-level site where it&#x27;s initially set and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. The aim is to allow cookies to be set by a third-party service, but only read within the context of the top-level site where they were initially set.
# Who is the origin trial for?
This trial is available as a third-party origin trial, which enables providers of embedded content to try out a new feature across multiple sites.
If a site enrolls in the trial as a first-party, the cookie partitioning functionality will be available to any third-party content …</p>

          <p>So, you bought a code signing certificate for your Electron app. One step closer to being able to release your app on Windows. Congrats!
Finally, 3 weeks later, after a few phone calls, Sectigo issued the certificate. Woohoo! The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.
In their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).
And then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.
So you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo? Haha nope,…</p>

          <p>Over the last decade, we’ve had the honor to welcome talented Ukrainian creatives to this community: more than 94,000 Dribbble designers and 1,200 Creative Market shops are based in Ukraine. On February 24, their lives and dreams were suddenly shattered by conflict. According to the UNHCR, the number of civilians fleeing Ukraine has now reached 2 million, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.
At Dribbble, we believe creativity thrives when human beings are free to design their lives without fear of violence. That’s why we’re partnering with the International Rescue Committee to provide relief to Ukrainians seeking refuge. Their teams are on the ground in Poland providing critical aid to families fleeing the conflict and trying to gain control over their future. Dribbble will donate $50,000 USD to this cause.
Over the coming days, we will also showcase Ukrainian creators across our platforms. We encourage you to support their extraordinary design work on Dribbble and ready-to-use assets on Creative Market’s new Finds Page.
We’re here to empower creatives to make a living doing what they love, in peace.

If you miss the days when all the youths donned Air Jordans, MTV actually played music, Fresh Prince was on regularly scheduled programming, and troll dolls adorned the dashboard of every oversized car, then you’re a true 80s kid at heart.
Continuing our Design by the Decades series, here is the 80s Edition. Interested in the 70s? Check out 70s graphic design trends to inspire you.
Exploring 80s graphic design trends
It turns out that a lot of those 80s trends have returned in modern times, so you’re in luck if you’re nostalgic for some good old 80s vibes. Remember the velvet couch that Grandma never got rid of?

          <p>Continuing with my JavaScript fun, I wanted to do an updated pass on the horizontal navs I’ve previously built for both GitHub Mobile (prior to the current responsive version and native apps) and this Bootstrap dashboard example.
The goal? Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.
Here’s the final demo via CodePen.

          <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/03/goodbye-big-freeda/ target="_blank">Goodbye, Big Freeda</a>
          <p>We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:
That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.
That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.
That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.
That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.
That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.
That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.
That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.
That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.
That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.
Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.
I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.</p>

          <p>Hi HN,
a while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).
So I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:
* Learning: Classic front/back prompts to memorize things. Think &quot;What is the capital of Argentina?&quot; on the front and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; on the back. Works with a spaced repetition algorithm so time between prompts is optimized.
* Habits: Recurring actions you want to do - you can set the frequency individually. For example &quot;Stand up and …</p>

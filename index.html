              <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30754394 target="_blank">Ask HN: What are some recommended patterns when using Web Components?</a>
              <p>The MDN Web docs [0] are useful to understand what are custom elements, the shadow DOM, or templates and slots. But as someone starting with web components and front-end stuff in general, I was wondering about the recommended approaches/design patterns when building more complex apps ?
For instance, how should components communicate with each other? By using a parent element systematically, firing up events from child nodes, then calling children methods from the parent node? Is this the equivalent of the &quot;props down, events up&quot; pattern in React for instance [1]?
Regarding the life-cycle, is there any reason to use the &#x60;constructor()&#x60; instead of the &#x60;connectedCallback()&#x60; for init code?
Another one that seems to have sparked some debate [2]: how to work with custom elements that need to interact with their children? Should I use &#x60;setTimeout()&#x60; to wait for the DOM to be parsed [3], should I use mutation observers, or should I fire up an event from the children to notify its parent when it is ready to be used?
These are just a couple questions that came up when reading about this, but I am curious about general best practices when building front-end apps using web components.

              <p>I&#x27;ve been looking to increase my use of the keyboard, primarily for the productivity gains that I find myself able to reach by consistently sticking to the keyboard. Since I started though, I&#x27;ve noticed fairly uneven support across applications. For example, reviewing my day&#x27;s worth of meetings and responding to each invitation using Google calendar is very painful to do on the keyboard.
What are people&#x27;s favorite recommendations of keyboard-based productivity tools?

              <p>Just wondering what could be the issue here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min()
Actually, I get the same error when trying to access max() also. I tried it in 4 different browser variations and all return the same error: &quot;developer.mozilla.org redirected you too many times.&quot;

              <p>I&#x27;m browsing with JS and cookies disabled for speed and safety. Lately, more and more simple and plain blogs require JS to show any text on website. Can we just agree on letting basic html do it&#x27;s thing? Why insist on JS to be able to show simple text on webpage?
For example:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30725933
Go ahead, disable JS and try opening blog on this link. Won&#x27;t happen...
This page is simple dark text on white background with some images sprinkled in. Why is JS required to show this?
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in this...

              <p>You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:
There is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.
It certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.
I hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.

              <p>Hey,
from time to time my intro isn’t entirely web-focused. I always struggle a bit when this is the case because usually it’s about sensitive topics which aren’t easy to discuss in public but this is a personal newsletter. And you can always skip the next paragraph. 
personal intro
When I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts.

Millennials rejoice! This one is for you. Are you ready to bring back the loud colors, dive deep into pop culture, wear everything tie-dye, and venture into the raver’s paradise?
Mainstream media certainly set the stage for everyone who grew up in the 90s to really be an “individual” and develop a sense of style. We still don’t know whether this was a good or bad thing… But one thing is for sure, we won’t ask you to use Comic Sans MS ever again.
Don’t forget to read up on 70s and 80s design trends before you get started!

              <p># What is CHIPS?
Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox proposal that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
A partitioned third-party cookie is tied to the top-level site where it&#x27;s initially set and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. The aim is to allow cookies to be set by a third-party service, but only read within the context of the top-level site where they were initially set.
# Who is the origin trial for?
This trial is available as a third-party origin trial, which enables providers of embedded content to try out a new feature across multiple sites.
If a site enrolls in the trial as a first-party, the cookie partitioning functionality will be available to any third-party content …</p>

              <p>So, you bought a code signing certificate for your Electron app. One step closer to being able to release your app on Windows. Congrats!
Finally, 3 weeks later, after a few phone calls, Sectigo issued the certificate. Woohoo! The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.
In their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).
And then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.
So you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo? Haha nope,…</p>

              <p>Over the last decade, we’ve had the honor to welcome talented Ukrainian creatives to this community: more than 94,000 Dribbble designers and 1,200 Creative Market shops are based in Ukraine. On February 24, their lives and dreams were suddenly shattered by conflict. According to the UNHCR, the number of civilians fleeing Ukraine has now reached 2 million, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.
At Dribbble, we believe creativity thrives when human beings are free to design their lives without fear of violence. That’s why we’re partnering with the International Rescue Committee to provide relief to Ukrainians seeking refuge. Their teams are on the ground in Poland providing critical aid to families fleeing the conflict and trying to gain control over their future. Dribbble will donate $50,000 USD to this cause.
Over the coming days, we will also showcase Ukrainian creators across our platforms. We encourage you to support their extraordinary design work on Dribbble and ready-to-use assets on Creative Market’s new Finds Page.
We’re here to empower creatives to make a living doing what they love, in peace.

If you miss the days when all the youths donned Air Jordans, MTV actually played music, Fresh Prince was on regularly scheduled programming, and troll dolls adorned the dashboard of every oversized car, then you’re a true 80s kid at heart.
Continuing our Design by the Decades series, here is the 80s Edition. Interested in the 70s? Check out 70s graphic design trends to inspire you.
Exploring 80s graphic design trends
It turns out that a lot of those 80s trends have returned in modern times, so you’re in luck if you’re nostalgic for some good old 80s vibes. Remember the velvet couch that Grandma never got rid of? Well, it’s back in style! Use it as a gorgeous design component in your home renovation project. Let’s just vow to leave teased hai…</p>

              <p>Continuing with my JavaScript fun, I wanted to do an updated pass on the horizontal navs I’ve previously built for both GitHub Mobile (prior to the current responsive version and native apps) and this Bootstrap dashboard example.
The goal? Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.
Here’s the final demo via CodePen.

              <p>We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:
That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.
That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.
That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.
That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.
That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.
That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.
That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.
That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.
That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.
Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.
I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.</p>

              <p>February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.
Survived the freeze
Texas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.

              <p>Hi HN,
a while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).
So I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:
* Learning: Classic front/back prompts to memorize things. Think &quot;What is the capital of Argentina?&quot; on the front and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; on the back. Works with a spaced repetition algorithm so time between prompts is optimized.
* Habits: Recurring actions you want to do - you can set the frequency individually. For example &quot;Stand up and …</p>

February 2022, as we track the milestones on the path to phasing out third-party
cookies in Chrome and working towards a more private web. In each edition, we
share an overview of the updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline
along with news from across the project—and the beginning of 2022 has
plenty of updates.
# Privacy Sandbox on Android
If you have been watching the Privacy Sandbox site, you may have noticed changes
to the structure as we introduced the Privacy Sandbox on
Android.
&quot;We’re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on
Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions.
Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data …</p>

Chrome 100 beta was released on March 3, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late March, 2022.
# Last Version for Unreduced User-Agent String
Chromium 100 will be the last version to support an unreduced User-Agent string by default (as well as the related navigator.userAgent, navigator.appVersion, and navigator.platform DOM APIs). The origin trial that allowed sites to test the fully reduced User-Agent will end on April 19, 2022. After that date, the User-Agent String will be gradually reduced. To review the whole schedule, see Chromium Blog: User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial and Dates. Sites that need more time to test or migrate to User-Agent Client Hints can enroll in the deprecation origin…</p>

              <p>It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an RSS feed reader. But everytime I try to get back to using it, I start by (re)installing Feedly, getting furstated by the lack of (what i believe are) key features. Try a bunch of other readers at random, getting fed up, and leave again.
This time, I&#x27;m determined not to let ignorance about good readers stop me.

But it should! 30-40% of web pages have a  element and 98% of all canvases use a Canvas2D rendering context.
There are Canvas2Ds in cars, on fridges, and in space (really).
Admittedly, the API is a bit behind the times when it comes to state-of-the-art 2D drawing.
Fortunately we&#x27;ve been hard at work implementing new features in Canvas2D to catch up to CSS, streamline ergonomics and improve performance.
# Part 1: catching up with CSS
CSS has a few drawing commands that are sorely missing from Canvas2D. With the new API we&#x27;ve added a handful of the most requested features:

              <p>Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:
The 15 minute fix
The 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)
I know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…
The 15 minute fix
The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…
Sometimes the compromise is worth it.…</p>

              <p>During my recovery I’ve made it a point to double down on improving my rather limited JavaScript skills. Courses have been helpful, but it seems that no matter the course, I do my best learning by making things myself. So I’ve been tinkering around and trying to build some new projects.
My latest experiment was to build something that allows me to toggle a class on an element with a particular id.


  Toggle



  This element will have the .blue class toggled on it.



The gist is that I want to use a  to toggle any class I want on another element of my choosing, all using data attributes so that it’s infinitely flexible and functional in any context.

              <p>I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.
Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.
With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.

ふるさとの街やかれ
身よりの骨うめし焼土に
今は白い花咲く
ああ許すまじ原爆を    
三度許すまじ原爆を    
われらの街に

ふるさとの海荒れて
黒き雨喜びの日はなく
今は舟に人もなし
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの海に

ふるさとの空重く
黒き雲今日も大地おおい
今は空に陽もささず
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの空に

はらからのたえまなき
労働にきずきあぐ富と幸
今はすべてついえ去らん
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
世界の上に

The city of my hometown
We buried the charred bones of our relatives
White flowers are blooming now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our city

The sea of my hometown is rough
There is no day of joy in black rain
There are no people in the boats now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sea

The sky of my hometown
Black clouds, the earth is covered today
Now the sun isn&#x27;t in the sky
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sky

No praise from the belly
Wealth and happiness is labor
I can&#x27;t leave everything now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
On top of the world</p>

              <p>Reassurance always runs out. Reassurance implies that the only reason to go forward is because it’s certain to work. Reassurance is futile. Encouragement means that someone sees us, understands us and believes in us. Even (especially) when things don’t turn out as we hoped. Encouragement lasts. Encouragement is self-fueling and self-fulfilling.</p>

              <p>Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.

Recently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).
Often we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)
One thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.
Tools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.

              <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
The count down to version 100 of Chrome and Firefox is just
weeks away.
CSS cascade layers gives you more control over your CSS, and
helps to prevent style-specificity conflicts.
The showPicker() method allows you to programmatically
show a browser picker for  elements like date, color, and
datalist.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 99.
# Chrome 100 and Firefox 100
Chrome 100 ships in late March (2022), and Firefox 100 ships shortly after in
early May. Both of these are a major version number milestone and roll over
to three digits. But, if your code is expecting two digits, the new version
number could cause issues for you.

              <a href=https://daverupert.com/2022/02/the-accordion/ target="_blank">Τ’ακορντεόν</a>
              <p>“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”
Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.
I first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.


Στη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο
που ήξερε και έπαιζε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν
όταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος
φωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Μα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ&#x27; άλλα
κράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν
φασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα
και μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Τ&#x27; αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει
όποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν
κι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει
δε θα περάσει ο φασισμός


In my old neighborhood I had a friend
who knew and played the accordion
when he sang, he was like the sun
fires in his hands ignited by the accordion

But at one dark night, like every other night
he kept a look-out playing the accordion
fascist trucks stood in the paddock
and a gun shot stopped the accordion

The started slogan comes back to me
whenever I hear an accordion
and it has marked my life like a stamp
&#x27;Fascism will not prevail!&#x27;</p>

              <p>The easy problems are often an illusion. If they were real and they were easy, they’d be solved already. Difficult problems, on the other hand, stick around until someone with insight, dedication and commitment shows up and gets to work. Seeking out difficult problems is far more effective than avoiding them.</p>

              <p>Throughout history, across the world, humans have shared their culture with others through song. Songs from their faith, country, region, race, culture, subculture, futbol team, or even the local tavern; a shared connection. The following is one of the songs from my community, a lament, I’d like to share with you all.
Been In This War For Too Long: Liturgical Demonstrations From Bygone Days by Seth Woods

G             D           C  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
G                 D  
We’ve got so much hurt  
Remember we’ve fallen so hard  
From our concrete towers to Earth  
Remember we sleep every night  
With doors locked and shades pulled down tight  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  

G             C       G  
We’re already so terrified  
Em                  C  
We just stay in one place  
We just cover our faces  
We just look at our hands  
Em                      C       D  
We just don’t know what time it is  

Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Just could you please be kind  
We’re grateful for so many things  
But you also gave us these minds  
Like you gave us the sky and the trees  
And we couldn’t keep them from harm  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
We’ve wired our hearts with alarm  

We just sit in these chairs now  
We just stare at these screens now  
We just work all the time now  
We just don’t know what day it is  

We’re tired and hungry for dreams now  
We’ve traded our love for relief  
When our casualties rise like black rivers  
From deserts to flood city streets  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Please don’t deny us our song  
We’re rambling, restless, and weary  
We’ve been in this war for too long  
We’re black and we’re blue and we’re broke down  
We’ve been in this war for too long

              <p>Starting from Chrome 101, the information available in the User-Agent (UA) string will be reduced using a phased approach. Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to migrate away from using the reduced User-Agent string and move toward User-Agent Client Hints can take part in a deprecation trial to continue receiving the full User-Agent string.
The registration for the deprecation trial will begin with the Chrome 100 Beta. It will allow sites to receive the full User-Agent string ahead of the Chrome 101 release, where the minor version string will be reduced. If you would like to test the origin trial on Chrome 100 Beta before it launches to the stable channel, be sure to register and test before the release date for Chrome 100 (currently scheduled for March 31st, 2022).

Nature was, therefore, a tremendous driving force behind the common visual themes of the 70s, including flowers, mushrooms, sunsets, and earthy browns, reds, yellows, and greens. Many of these trends are a continuation of popular elements of psychedelic 1960s designs. Still, many 70s styles have also come into their own through the emergence of 70s rock, pop culture, the growth of advertising, and the beginning of mass-produced media.

Encourages the professional growth and development of your team members.
Helps you refine your systems and processes.

              <p>Someone in a Slack group I’m a member of shared recently shared a link to a post by Cory Doctorow titled The Memex Method. In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:
The very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.
That’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.

              <p>Hey,
This year marks fifteen years of freelancing in my life. That’s 100% of my work life and nearly half the time I live on this world. So I wrote something down on it on my blog. WDRL itself will turn 10 next year already which amazes me when I think about it. I want to say thank you to all who subscribe to my newsletter, who support me with recommendations to others, with money contributions or other things. You’re keeping this project alive and make it a usually joyful thing to send out a new edition.
To close the intro and dive into the articles, I want to share this mini documentary about my work-life in which I share how I combine web development and market gardening today as well as how to protect yourself from burn-out situations:

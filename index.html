            <p class="mt-0.5">The past year has seen a healthy debate around the term ‘Jamstack’ as the definition gets stretched to include new use cases. I recently posted my take on a Jamstack definition in “Static vs. Dynamic vs. Jamstack: Where’s The Line?”…

            <p class="mt-0.5">I don’t work with CSS much, but whenever I do, I’m continually blown away by how much easier modern CSS is now than it was five years ago.
I was working on a side-project this weekend, and the :not() pseudo-selector made my life a lot easier!
What the :not() pseudo-selector does The :not() pseudo-selector lets you select elements, but exclude ones that match an additional set of selectors. Pass in the selectors to ignore as an argument.</p>

            >Ask HN: Language design to mitigate supply chain attacks?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5">Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

It consists of three main tools… Write Good Linter, Microsoft Edge’s Read Aloud feature, and Squoosh. It’s about 30-50 minutes worth of work and puts that final bit of polish on my posts before I ship it out to the world.
Export from Notion (1 min)

As I said in my last post, I now do all my blogging in Notion. Exporting from Notion is straightforward. It provides you with a Markdown file and a folder full of images inside a Zip file. I extract the ZIP and copy past the contents into a new draft on my blog inside VS Code.
Open in VS Code for last-minute edits. (15 minutes)

 One of the most understated features of pair programming, and a big part of why it is “worth it”, is that you never really get stuck on something for several days, as can happen often when soloing…
Your pair keeps your assumptions in check.
A pair helps you pump the brakes and clarify up front the assumptions about why something is broken or the assumptions about how to implement a feature.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Hi everyone,
I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).
She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I&#x27;m currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I&#x27;m getting more and more bored every day.
However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I&#x27;m not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I&#x27;ve done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.
Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)

            <p class="mt-0.5">Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, “Please, sir, I want some more.” 
Here’s the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Mark Brown from Game Maker’s Toolkit is making a game. After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.
What is the right direction? Well… the answer is: Prototypes.
Mark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn’t any fun. Mark said it felt shallow, repetitive, and dull. In his own words:
It comes down to making two very wrong assumptions. Assumption #1 is the game always felt kind of cool in my head, so I just kind of assumed the game wo…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 96 beta was released on October 21, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late November, 2021.
# The &quot;basic-card&quot; method of PaymentRequest API
The PaymentRequest API has deprecated the basic card payment
method. Its usage is low
and declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in
time-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment
methods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung
Pay.
# Removal timeline
Chrome 96
The basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.
Chrome 100
The basic-card method will be removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            >Auto Dark Theme</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5">Chrome 96 introduces an Origin Trial for Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to light themed sites,
when the user has opted into dark themes in the Operating System.
Users can opt-out of dark themes by either disabling the option on the OS level or in a specific setting in Chrome.
# Sign-up for the Origin Trial
You can also enable the darkening algorithm for your users, via an Origin Trial.
This will allow you to test how the Auto Dark Theme performs with regards to your KPIs.
Head over to the documentation to learn
how to set up an Origin Trial,
then sign-up for the AutoDarkMode origin trial to get a token.

These startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality. Given that we were sure CI/CD would be the future of software development, we decided to dedicate our start…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">For the past year I’ve been on a team of folks inside Open UI dedicated to figuring out how get a native, accessible  element into HTML. We’re a team of people with varying backgrounds; spec authors, browser vendors, implementors, and normie practitioners like myself. Open UI is a community group so we can’t technically make HTML (for legal reasons), but we can present research to the W3C working groups. I see Open UI as an ad hoc research arm for the W3C with specific experience in design systems and common web componentry.
The “Tabvengers” as we’re known, have produced a couple research documents and experiments so far:

            <p class="mt-0.5">One of the projects in the Vanilla JS Academy uses the Ron Swanson Quotes API to get a random Ron Swanson quote and inject it into the UI.
One of the more common ways I see students get tripped up by this project is with type coercion.
Today, I wanted to explain what it is and how it works. Let’s dig in!
What is type coercion? JavaScript will sometimes coerce an item of one type (for example, a string) into another (for example, a number).</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">I want to design a back in stock notification email service, where the users can sign up on the out-of-stock page and get notified when the item is back in stock.
If I have the list of users subscribed to back in stock alert and another table that has latest stock availability, what would be the best appraoch to build an efficient system that looks at these data and trigger back in stock email ?
- Do I poll the stock table for change in stock and then compare with user table and trigger email ? 
- Is there any other better ways of doing it ? Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.
I am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.

no, you didn’t miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it’ll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.

            >Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5">When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority in an attempt to download resources in an optimal order. These priorities can depend on the kind of resource and where it is in the document. For example, in-viewport images may have a High priority while the priority for early 
 loaded, render-blocking CSS in the 
 could be Very High. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities that work well but may not be optimal in all cases.
In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss Priority Hints and the importance attribute, which allow you to hint at the relative importance of a resource (high or low). Priority Hints can help optimize the Core Web Vitals.

And… it works! If you’re wondering why I made this, the tl;dr is that Sass has a superior way of adjusting the alpha channel on ANY COLOR (rgb, hsl, named color, etc) but that does not work with CSS Custom Properties. This little paint worklet restores that flavor of color manipulation to backgrounds and borders. Here’s a video with a more in-depth explanation:

Nearly all web apps depend on routing in some way whether it&#x27;s code running
on a server that maps a path to files on disk or logic in a single-page app
that updates the DOM when the URL changes. URLPattern is a new web
platform API that standardizes routing pattern syntax.

            <p class="mt-0.5">Hi HN,
I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.
For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.
The most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.
That could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.
But I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 &quot;blobs&quot; on it that represent min, max and most likely.
The advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.
I then went on Google to see if there is any research to &quot;Designing Components&quot; but I&#x27;m kinda overwhelmed by &quot;top 10 UI/UX component&quot; answers and MATERIAL.
So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?

            <p class="mt-0.5">This is an API guide with detailed usage examples for the Reporting

  Reporting API (Report-To header), head over to the migration post

Some errors only occur in production. You won&#x27;t see them locally or during development because
real users, real networks, and real devices change the game. The Reporting API helps
catch some of these errors⏤such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API
calls⏤across your site, and transmits them to an endpoint you&#x27;ve specified. It lets you declare what
you&#x27;d like to monitor via HTTP headers, and is operated by the browser.
Setting up the Reporting API gives you peace of mind that when users experience these types of
errors, you&#x27;ll…</p>

  API (v1). If you&#x27;re new to the Reporting API or need detailed usage examples, head over to the main
  post on the Reporting API instead. 

The Reporting API informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.
A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.
The legacy Reporting API is named Reporting API v0. The new Reporting API is named
Reporting API v1.

            <p class="mt-0.5">The Scala compiler is a fascinating tool which powers a large proportion of the Guardian’s infrastructure. But sometimes the work that it does can seem somewhat mysterious. Guardian Scala developer Paul Roberts explores in detail one aspect of this mystery and looks at how understanding it can help us write code more effectively
Scala is the programming language which underpins many of the most important tools which allow the Guardian to deliver its journalism. And when compared to other languages, Scala has a lot of wonderful tools for making your code simpler. However, sometimes this is achieved by hiding a lot of the complexity. Usually this is a good thing – it’s the compiler writer’s problem and we have the luxury of just being able to ignore it and get on with what we are trying to do. But occasionally it can actually influence the way our code is running and as a result, present us with surprises.
To have something to work with, I began playing around with solutions to Project Euler problem 39 (spoilers for problems after 100 are discouraged but this one is OK).
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p &#x3D; 120.
{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

This talk had two major objectives. Firstly, In January 2021 I joined the W3C Web Components Community Group, which is hoping to advance Web Components and raise awareness. It’s a worthwhile cause to get over some of Web Components’ historical marketing problems. I also get a chance to provide feedback on nascent stage proposals. I’m a fringe member in this group, but happy to escalate any questions or feedback you have.
The second reason I wanted to talk about Web Components is that I feel there’s an education gap.  I noticed that nearly all the people I know that love HTML, CSS, and Design System…</p>

I’m financially engaged with Kevin and I like Texas BBQ, so I thought I’d go. I also thought my former neighbor Cleo was going to be there and wouldn’t it be fun to surprise her.
Cleo didn’t show up. Foiled! I thought she always went to this thing. Ugh. Okay. Reset. I made due, grabbed a plat of free BBQ and sat down. I was now on my own in a sea of retirees running the same free BBQ grift I was running. There were two people under 60: my financial advisor and the person he invited to be the guest speaker. I failed at making small talk, so my tablemates and I sat the long table poking at our meats and the conversation centered around passing the potato salad.

            <p class="mt-0.5">This week I came across an article titled “Why don’t video games take sex seriously?”… so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I’m a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he’s a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I’m not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang’s work.
Back to the article about video game sex. One particular passage stuck out to me…

My solution for counting words looks like this.
// Split the text content into an array, using spaces to break words // Use Array.filter() to remove any words without a length // (this removes double spaces in the content) let words &#x3D; text.value.split(&#x27; &#x27;).filter(function (word) { return word.length; });  One of my students has a solution that looks like this.</p>

 Why is it harder to make a website in 2021 than it was in 1996?
I mean, writing your own HTML in Notepad and uploading it via FTP was a chore. But it was understandable and easy.
If you want to create a fanpage of some obscure topic, everything is just … too much. So instead, people will create an Instagram/TikTok/Facebook/etc and start posting there.</p>

Let’s level set a bit and talk a bit about the different flavors of wiggle room:
Super Fast Hardware #
Here’s a screenshot of a Lighthouse result from this morning, October 14th, 2021, run on an old MacBook Air (2012) using Chrome 86.
Here’s the same result on my MacBook Air (M1, 2020) using Chrome 94:
It’s incredible to me the variability effect that your hardware can have: from a 64 on Performance to a 94—that’s a thirty point swing!
Don’t Do This™ Evil Tip: When running Lighthouse, only use the best, beefiest, latest and greatest, most expensive hardware and network connections.…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it’s sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.
Episode six is all about design principles. That’s a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.
But for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.
Katie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite’s time for her to talk me through it. I’ve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.
It’s nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.

And with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!</p>

It quickly became my most popular product.

For this virtual hack day of 2021, we had a dedicated focus: Cop26 and the environment. The recent IPCC report makes for grim reading which is why we decided to focus our attention on developing new interactive tools for our readers to stay informed. We produced and presented 19 amazing hacks over the two-day event, including a tool to read product ingredients and determine if they are vegan or not, a visualisation of the world showing data about temperature changes over the last century, an app for extending the life of all your belongings and keeping them out of landfill and an app that uses data from waqi.io to provide the quality of air by location. Below is a selection of the best concepts and designs from the event.

It has me thinking about sustainability models for this style of web framework—what are other folks doing to fund development? Recent news would suggest that more and more folks are going the route of taking investment. It has me considering the hidden costs of such routes.

            <p class="mt-0.5">A “dark pattern” is a deceptive UX pattern that tricks users into doing things they may not really want to do. In this article, Alvaro Montoro does a little experiment to find out how much privacy is taken away from users across three different browsers.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">The Situation persists. But it has changed. There are no longer any official restrictions to speak of here in England. Instead it’s down to everyone to figure out individually what’s right.
Everyone is evaluating the risks, making calculations and coming to different conclusions. It’s only natural that everyone—myself incuded—thinks they’ve found the Goldilocks zone. “That person is being far too blasé! And that person is being far too cautious! But I’m doing exactly the right thing.”
With that in mind, I’m trying not to be judgemental about the decisions other people are making (apart from the decsion not to get vaccinated—I’m judgemental as hell about those selfish assholes). For example, I wear a mask when I’m on public transport. Other people don’t. I try not to judge them (although re…</p>

I&#x27;m Ian Kilpatrick,
an engineering lead on the Blink layout team, along with Koji Ishii.
Before working on the Blink team,
I was a front-end engineer (before Google had the role of &quot;front-end engineer&quot;),
building features within Google Docs, Drive, and Gmail.
After around five years in that role I took a large gamble switching to the Blink team,
effectively learning C++ on the job,
and attempting to ramp up on the massively complex Blink codebase.
Even today, I only understand a relatively small portion of it.
I&#x27;m grateful for the time given to me during this period.

            >Assessing loading performance in the field with Navigation Timing and Resource Timing</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5">If you&#x27;ve used connection throttling in the network panel in a browser&#x27;s developer tools (or Lighthouse in Chrome) to assess loading performance, you know how convenient those tools are for performance tuning. You can quickly measure the impact of performance optimizations with a consistent and stable baseline connection speed. The only problem is that this is synthetic testing, which yields lab data, not field data.
Synthetic testing isn&#x27;t inherently bad, but it&#x27;s not representative of how fast your website is loading for real users. That requires field data, which you can collect from the Navigation Timing and Resource Timing APIs.

            <p class="mt-0.5">Groupe Renault is a French multinational automobile manufacturer with a presence in over 130 countries. For an automotive group such as Renault, performant brand sites driving more user engagement and conversions mean more business. All of its brand sites aim at providing the best user experience at scale while maintaining flexibility of content and features for localized sites. In this context, performance monitoring is a key stake for the customer experience team which is in charge of developing and maintaining the global platform.

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I’m particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.
Some highlights…

The big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It’s thrice weekly’ish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel. I wrote a bit about it, but Chris and I are having a good time making videos. We’re up to 12 videos so far. That’s a helluva cadence so there’ll be some breaks, but so far feels pretty sustainable.

Let’s dig in!
Using the Array.splice() method The Array.splice() method accepts three arguments: start, delete, and items.
The first, start, is the index of the item you want to modify in the array. It’s the only required argument.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn’t support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#x27; lives easier.

When Roberto was 10 years old, he went to the library with his dad. There was a little computer in the corner that caught his interest and he left with every book on computing he could find. At home, Roberto took out a pad of paper and started writing his first code. Years later, when Roberto decided he probably couldn’t follow his original dream of being a mathematician, he decided to pursue a career in computing.
What was the path that eventually brought you to the Guardian?

            <p class="mt-0.5">A new episode of the Clearleft podcast just dropped and I have to say, this is one of my favourites so far. It’s all about measuring design.
There was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn’t there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?
For this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.
This episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it’s well worth your time. Have a listen.

This is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Applications deal with untrusted strings all the time, but safely rendering that content as part of an HTML document can be tricky. Without sufficient care, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally create opportunities for cross-site scripting (XSS) that malicious attackers may exploit.
To mitigate that risk, the new Sanitizer API proposal aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page. This article introduces the API, and explains its usage.

            <p class="mt-0.5">Bootstrap v5.1.2 is here with a handful of improvements across our components, plus a fix for an issue in another project that prevented our Sass from compiling properly. Keep reading for the highlights.
Highlights
Temporarily patched a postcss-values-parser issue by rearranging our calc() functions that use negative numbers. This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap’s Sass in create-react-app.
Added border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects
Added align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers
Fixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children
Updated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN
Improved docs around .img-fluid
Added role&#x3D;&quot;switch&quot; to our form switches in our docs
Implemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.
Up next
Up next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we’ll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap

            <p class="mt-0.5">Many sites use third-party embeds to create an engaging user experience by delegating some sections of a web page to another content provider. The most common examples of third-party content embeds are video players, social-media feeds, maps, and advertisements.
Third-party content can impact the performance of a page in many ways. It can be render-blocking, contend with other critical resources for network and bandwidth, or affect the Core Web Vitals metrics. Third-party embeds may also cause layout shifts as they load. This article discusses performance best practices that you can use when loading third-party embeds, efficient loading techniques, and the Layout Shift Terminator tool that helps reduce layout shifts for popular embeds.

Previous episodes
In C++, ruling out the possibility of data races comes down to a small thread-safety correctness proof for every data member access.
These proofs add up to a lot of mental toil, especially when reviewing or refactoring code.
Clang&#x27;s static analysis framework takes over the toil of thread-safety proofs.
# Add GUARDED_BY_CONTEXT() to data members in thread-unsafe classes
Most Chrome classes are thread-unsafe, and should be used on a single sequence.
Add annotations to all data members that are not thread-safe.
Unnecessary annotations are safe, but missing annotations are a risk of data races.

            <p class="mt-0.5">On this day twenty years ago I wrote the first entry in my online journal. In the intervening two decades I’ve written a further 2,817 entries.
I am now fifty years old, which means I’ve been blogging for two fifths of my lifetime.
My website has actually been around for longer than twenty years, but its early incarnations had no blog. That all changed when I relaunched the site on September 30th, 2001.
I wrote at the time:
I’m not quite sure what I will be saying here over the coming days, weeks, months and years.
Honestly I still feel like that.
I think it’s safe to assume an “anything goes” attitude for what I post here. Being a web developer, there’s bound to be lots of geeky, techy stuff but I also want a place where I can rant and rave about life in general.
That’s been pretty true, …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">We’re past the halfway mark for this season of the Clearleft podcast. Episode four came out today. It’s all about innovation.
At the beginning of the episode, I think you can hear the scorn in my voice. Y’see, innovation is one of the words—like “disruptive”—that gets thrown around a lot and everyone assumes it only has positive connotations. But words like “innovative” and “disruptive” can be applied to endeavours that are not good for the world.
Bitcoin, for example, could rightly be described as innovative (and disruptive) but it’s also a planet-destroying ponzi scheme—like a lovechild of the trolley problem and the paperclip maximizer designed to generate the most amount of waste for the least amount of value.
So, yeah, I’m not a fan of innovation for innovation’s sake. But don’t worry. For this episode of the podcast I set my personal feelings to one side and let the episode act as a conduit for much smarter people.
The whole thing clocks in at 25 minutes but I think this episode might have the widest range of contributors yet. There are snippets from an internal Clearleft discussion, soundbites from a panel discussion, extracts from conference talks, as well as interviews with individuals. From Clearleft there’s Chris How, Andy Thornton, Jon Aizlewood and Lorenzo Ferronato. From the panel discussion there’s Janna Bastow, Matt Cooper-Wright, Dorota Biniecka and Akshan Ish. And from UX Fest there’s Radhika Dutt, Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein.
I happily defer to their expertise on this topic. Have a listen and hear what they have to say.</p>

For instance: Drag files/folders onto the browser window and drop them. The likely use case there is uploading. Drag an element on the […]

            <p class="mt-0.5">Each season of the Clearleft podcast has six episodes. Three of the six episodes of the current season are available with another three still to come.
In case you missed them, the episodes of season three released so far are:
Coaching
What’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentorship?
Design Engineering
A role that sits at the intersection—or rather, the gap—between design and engineering.
Design Research
The journey from evaluative research to generative research.
That’s quite a mixed bag. You might think that there’s no particular unifying to a season of the podcast.
Well, that’s kind of true. There’s no specific theme. But each season does have a meta-grouping.
At Clearleft, we think about our services in three interconnected categories: explore, create, and grow.
“Explore” is all about the big strategic picture.
“Create” is the nitty-gritty work of delivery.
“Grow” is what connects those together.
Each season of the podcast focuses on one of those categories. This season it’s all about “explore” with a bit of “grow” thrown in.
The next three episodes of this season will double down on the big-picture thinking. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but I’ll just remind you that if you’re not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, I highly recommend rectifying that situation.
Subscribe via RSS, or on Apple, Google, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts from.
And if you’re already subscribed …thank you. If you’re enjoying listening to it half as much as I’m enjoying making it, then I’m enjoying it twice as much as you.
Seriously though, if you like what you hear, please share it around. Drop a link to the Clearleft podcast into your work Slack channel or share it in a tweet.
Thank you for listening.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5">Over the years we&#x27;ve made a number of product and policy improvements to help ensure a quality
experience for both users and developers. As part of this work, we&#x27;ve updated our best practices,
and identifiednamed undesirable behaviors that create spammy experiences for users. Today, we&#x27;re
furthering this work by clarifying and updating two policies, to keep the quality of extensions
high, and the experience for developers consistent:
# Keyword Spam Update
Keyword Spam is the practice of including irrelevant or excessive keywords in an extensions
description in an attempt to manipulate its ranking, resulting in a spammy, negative user
experience. We don&#x27;t allow extensions with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive,
irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but …</p>

              class="text-stone-300 hover:text-white visited:text-stone-500 font-medium"
            >Chrome user device characteristics report</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5">Developers are constantly wondering about what kind of audience they are
developing for. Are they using high end devices with large RAM? What connection
are they using (for example Wi-Fi, 2G) and so on. The answers to these questions
can affect product development decisions such as choosing the
technologies to render the content. This report provides timeline data to inform
developers on these questions for a list of countries, such as the US, Brazil,
Japan, and others. Three platforms are included when data is available: Android,
Windows, and ChromeOS.
Looking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to
think about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of
users have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in
the US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another
example: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices
have RAM larger than 5 GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower
than India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help
developers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device
characteristics.
This data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.
In Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google
to help improve Chrome&#x27;s feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash
reports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled
during installation or in Chrome&#x27;s settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,
and metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable
with other datasets.  If the metrics collection is re-enabled, the unique
identifier will also be reset. We used the data collected to calculate the
various statistics in this
report.

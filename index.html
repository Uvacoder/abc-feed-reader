          <p>Feels like every company I&#x27;ve seen has a different process, and always all over the place. I see hard to understand diagrams in various places, sometimes even outdated. I also see data models all over the place between services, sometimes held inside an excel sheet. Also there&#x27;s no standardized system that people actually use (Like UML but I rarely seen it used.) Maybe I&#x27;m just at the wrong companies and other companies have it all figured out?

          <p>I&#x27;m currently working on a side-project that, for a change, I&#x27;d like to fully structure first before diving into the code.
I know there are specific UI/UX tools, like Framer, Adobe XD and Sketch. There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.
What I&#x27;m looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to &#x27;zoom in&#x27; on specific layers for more detail.
Is there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that&#x27;s not made for it but works well?

          <p>I&#x27;ve run my blog for 21 years. I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I&#x27;ve been polishing it up recently to get back into it.
It used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but people knew what to do with it. I&#x27;ve maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?
Firefox used to offer subscription options but I don&#x27;t see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.
In the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I&#x27;m writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?
I&#x27;ve been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on. Feeling pretty old right now.

          <p>The mobile-first design methodology is great—it focuses on what really matters to the user, it’s well-practiced, and it’s been a common design pattern for years. So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too…right? 
Well, not necessarily. Classic mobile-first CSS development is based on the principle of overwriting style declarations: you begin your CSS with default style declarations, and overwrite and/or add new styles as you add breakpoints with min-width media queries for larger viewports (for a good overview see “What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?”). But all those exceptions create complexity and inefficiency, which in turn can lead to an increased testing effort and a code base that’s harder to maintain. Admit it—how many of us willingly want that?

Installed PWAs can register as file handlers, making it
easy for users to open files directly from disk.
The inert attribute allows you to mark parts of the DOM as inert.
The Navigation API makes it easier for single page apps

see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 102.
# File Handling API
The File Handling API allows installed PWAs to register with the OS as a file
handler. Once registered, a user can click on a file to open it with the
installed PWA. This is perfect for PWAs that interact with files, for example,
image editors, IDEs, text editors, and so on.
To add file handling functionality to your PWA, you&#x27;ll need to update your

          <p>In the 90&#x27;s, a number of teenagers made Geocities sites, which awakened their interest in web development and taught them some basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Many of these teens went on to become web developers.
Later, many teenagers learned these skills as they customized their LiveJournal or MySpace.
Later still, many teenagers learned these skills customizing their Tumblr.
Does Gen Z have anything like this, that is creating a pipeline to web development? I know Tumblr and LiveJournal still exist, but they don&#x27;t seem to be popular with Gen Z at all.

          <p>I&#x27;m writing an RSS reader, and I noticed that items often miss publication dates. Regardless, other readers seem to be able to gather them anyway, I&#x27;m guessing through the actual site.
Is this generally done through web scraping, archival information, web crawler data, or something else entirely?
I&#x27;m asking because I would hate to resort to those types of methods as they are generally heavy on resources and unstable.

          <p>Industries are often held together by unspoken hierarchies, signposts on the road to achievement. In the fancy parts of the book business, it’s not profit. Editors are often unaware of which books are truly profitable. They keep track of cultural impact, literary respect, the idea of a book being ‘well published’ and the hard-to-measure currency […]</p>

Reporting. There are a number of available developer resources and code samples
to get started.
To generate summary reports in the origin trial, you&#x27;ll first need to set up
the aggregation service. This blog post gives an overview of those steps.
If you ran an origin trial with this API in 2021, follow the migration
guide
to prepare for the latest origin trial.

Otis’s team, the Athletics, squeaked their way through to the finals and ended up winning the Northwest Little League championship. 🎉
A happy, unexpected end to our first full season of baseball. Seeing the growth of every kid on every team over the course of a season was a treat. At the beginning of the season no one can pitch and it’s a walk-a-…</p>

Denialism, on the other hand, is a willful rejection of reality. It’s safe and easy, and unproductive. Because there’s no room to change your mind. To be a generous skeptic, […]</p>

          <p>There are so many books and resources titled Design Patterns in X language but all of them seem to be teaching it in a way that aren&#x27;t ideal in a practical situation.
Most of them just look like the language was used like Java style Gang of Four or Head First Design Patterns.
Are there any books that teach design patterns without either relying on a language or using the language specific idioms correctly?

          <p>Hey!
I’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.
This can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is
Measuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.
What are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?

We could do it directly in HTML:

Packaging plays a significant role in selling a product when it is done creatively and correctly. There’s more to promotional products than applying a logo to a box or creating a fancy label. Consumers are attracted to it, and it communicates a message.
In most cases, the packaging is used to protect products. Now packaging design is diverse. Although most packaging is designed to keep products safe, others help brands stand out and entertain customers. It can be why a customer tries a product for the first time.
Whether it’s clean, muted colors or whimsical details that lighten the mood, the designs customers gravitate towards these days show the impact creative packaging has on their buying decisions.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Although Y2K itself was popular between 1995 and 2004, we will focus on designs from the early 2000s. In fact, since looks come into fashion again after about twenty years, we’re right on schedule!
The Y2K looks emphasize technology and futuristic looks, mainly in the form of shiny skin-tight clothes and silver-blue eyeshadow. During this time, technology such as Windows 95, PlayStation, and N64 were at their peak. Pokemon had just been released in Japan and the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys were sweeping the nation. These years played a crucial role in the culture of 30 somethings around the globe.
Missed the first three in this series? We’ve got you covered. Explore 70s, 80s, and 90s design trends here:

          <p>Hi HN,
while building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.
So, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.
The first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.
We are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.
Cheerz :)

          <p>Hello HN! Author here :)
I&#x27;ve finished upgrading the Hacker News reading app that I made sometime earlier.
Among previous features, I added some new ones - which include:
- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later, and   the newly added comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier);
- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in;
- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).
The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it&#x27;s client side rendered.
The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.
Let me know what you think about the app in the comments.
Thanks!

          <p>The last two years have greatly accelerated the transition into hybrid work, but that’s not when remote collaboration started. With a growing reliance on digital tools, many of us have been working together across vast distances for a number of years.

          <p>I was on the 

PodRocket podcast (from the folks at 

LogRocket)
We talk to Zach Leatherman, creator and maintainer of Eleventy, about Eleventy, what it was like to be acquired by Netlify, and how Eleventy reached 3 million downloads on npm.
Although I wouldn’t say “acquired” is the right term—Netlify is sponsoring Eleventy 😅

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31562460 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are JS bundlers filling a design flaw?</a>
          <p>I don’t have a lot of experience in Node development. From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.
From looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.
Shouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?
These things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31563325 target="_blank">Ask HN: How often are you operating at 100% productivity/motivation?</a>
          <p>Sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like working. Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn&#x27;t have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.
How do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?
Maybe it&#x27;s just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.
I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.

          <p>I enjoyed this article by Jeremy Keith on writing alt text for images. In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an . It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).
As a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.
Another time alt…</p>

          <p>How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?
Examples of experiments:
 - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.
 - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.
 - Try intermittent fasting.
 - Start writing tests first (TDD).
I wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the &quot;scientific method&quot; on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.

          <p>Mine: overlay on video (especially when they&#x27;re not full screened).
They&#x27;re often too obstructive for no reason (often has a too large dark gradient that blocks bottom or top of the video), takes forever to disappear, and hard to operate (very easy to accidentally pause the video). For example, CC button for YouTube: it totally could be below the video element.
This is especially annoying on mobile since there is not keyboard shortcuts.

          <p>In Austin we have three types of trash: trash, recycling, and compost. And then if I’m honest there’s a fourth and fifth variety: e-waste and a bag of old clothes and toys to donate. The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.
The side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem. Our recycling… well, our recycling is always full and overflowing. You see, we’re bottlenecked by the city’s two week pick up cycle. When the bin fills up we create staging areas with paper bags to triage the excess recycling. The minute the city hauls off the previous load, we’ve filled up half of our capacity on our next tw…</p>

          <p>I know I’m not alone in browsing hacker news on my phone.
On mobile devices the flag/hide buttons are super close to the article and comment links. I hit them all the time unintentionally.
Maybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?
I have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.

Chrome 103 beta was released on May 26, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late June, 2022.
# Block external protocol in sandboxed iframes
Sandboxed iframes are not blocked from opening external applications. Currently, developers sandbox untrusted content and block user navigation. Blocking probably should have also included links to external apps or to the Play store. This has now been fixed.
Sites that need navigation can add the following values to the  element&#x27;s sandbox property:
allow-popups
allow-top-navigation
allow-top-navigation-with-user-activation

          <p>CHIPS is a Privacy
Sandbox proposal that introduces a mechanism to opt-in to having third-party
cookies partitioned by top-level site using a new cookie attribute,
Partitioned.
The experiment started in Chrome 100 on March 29, 2022 and was scheduled to run
until June 14, 2022.
To give developers more time to test the feature and gather more feedback, an
extension to the experiment will run through Chrome 104 until the release of Chrome 105, on August 30, 2022.
Starting in version 103, Chrome will include an alternative CHIPS origin trial design for HTTP
cookies, which should enable an opt-in mechanism that will make deployment
easier for large organizations.
In the new design, sending Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Partitioned-Cookies header will
no longer be required to enroll in the origin trial. Sites will only need to
send the Origin-Trial header with their CHIPS origin trial token when they are sending
responses that include the Set-Cookie header with the Partitioned
attribute.
To enroll in the origin trial and start experimenting, head over to
CHIPS origin trial instructions.</p>

          <p>Up until the latest redesign of the Bootstrap documentation, our blog and Icons sites were including Bootstrap’s compiled CSS and JavaScript via CDN. This worked great overall and gave, but I found myself needing and wanting more granular control over the final production assets. In particular, I wanted the source Sass files, but just the compiled JS for now. Despite using Hugo for years now in Bootstrap’s docs, I’m a complete Hugo newbie, so I had no idea how to actually include Bootstrap with npm in a Hugo project. So I set out to fix that.
The solution I used is straightforward, but I didn’t see many clear and concise answers on it outside some forum threads: use the Hugo mounts system. So, after you create your package.json and npm i bootstrap, you setup your Hugo config to pull from t…</p>

Targeting required fields and validation values with just CSS and HTML was very […]

          <p>Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.
Tamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.
All of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.
I think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a &#x60;size&#x60; prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.

          <p>It’s a stepping-stone, not a compromise. The media and our culture push us to build something for everyone, to sand off the edges and to invest in infrastructure toward scale. But it turns out that quality, magic and satisfaction can lie in the other direction. Not because we can’t get bigger, but because we’d rather […]</p>

          <p>There are tons of conflicting opinions on the best approach to architecting and designing large scale software. I&#x27;d love to hear some anecdotes for what&#x27;s really worked in the real world.
Bonus points if the pattern was used in a large scale web app with multiple clients and a common backend api.

          <p>I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?
Obviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.
To test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase &quot;survey&quot; engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.
Love to hear your thoughts and feedback: https://tuun.app/
Best,

          <p>Just because they’re easy to measure doesn’t mean they matter. If they appear in round numbers and are easily compared to those from others, we’re tempted to compare.

Something that could jeopardize that is a bad client. But do you always get to choose whom you work with?

          <p>I know there is no alternative to having actualy experiencing designing and coding software by working at a company like Aamzon or Spotify but if you are stuck at a B2B enterprise company you barely deal with complex challenges at scale and distributed system. At a senior (Staff/Pricipal) level its a deadlock between getting into a roll which does it and learning hands on. Guess &quot;Design a uber&quot; design questions in yourtube is not enough. Any comprehensive resources or habit that can help ?

          <p>Welcome to the start of year edition of &quot;Progress in the Privacy
Sandbox&quot;, covering March and April
2022, as we track the milestones on the path to phasing out third-party cookies
in Chrome and working towards a more private web. In each edition, we share an
overview of the updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline
along with news from across the project.
# Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial
Early developer feedback and the ability to evolve proposals based on that
feedback continues to be a top priority for us. We have opened a combined
origin trial for Attribution Reporting, FLEDGE, and Topics to allow for
initial feedback on these APIs in real world environments.
We&#x27;re starting with a very small proportion of users on the Chrome Beta channel,
starting with Chrome 101. …</p>

          <p>We are thrilled to have the first round of tooling support for the new experimental responsiveness metric, Interaction to Next Paint (INP). To learn about the metric itself, check out the official INP metric guide.
# Suggested measurement
The goal of measuring INP is to understand how fast your page responds to user input. The only way to get realistic data is to measure how your page is responding for real users visiting your site using data from the field.
Measuring INP in the lab then helps to better understand event timings and where optimizations need to happen. Lab tools won&#x27;t automatically interact with the page, so they either need manual input while they measure, or they need to be scripted with an automation tool like Puppeteer. When key interactions are identified from typical u…</p>

          <p>I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:
- forums
- Blogger/Wordpress
- personal portfolio sites
- YouTube for tutorial videos
- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr
- Gumroad for digital products
None of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.
I want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.
Why is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.0-beta1 added a slew of CSS custom properties, or CSS variables, across the :root level and all our core components. Here’s a quick look at how you can utilize them in your projects.
With CSS variables, you can now customize Bootstrap easier than ever, and without the need for a CSS preprocessor. All the power of Sass is still there behind the scenes, but CSS variables adds a ton of power for the future. Use and compose new values, updates styles globally without recompiling, set fallback values, setup new color modes, and more.
Let’s dig in.
CSS variables?
Their official name is custom properties, but they’re often referred to as CSS variables thanks to their most immediate use case for setting specific values. Consider reading the MDN CSS custom properties article or the C…</p>

          <p>Did you know, if you use CSS math functions like min(), max() and clamp() and you’re calculating any one of the arguments, you don’t need calc()? I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.
So if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);
}
You can do this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);
}
It totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!
It works with custom properties too — check out this demo.
Incidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.</p>

            >Four days</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I had an extra long weekend recently. It was four days of being a culture vulture. It was also four days of ever-increasing risk assessment.
It began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe‚Äîthree of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could‚Äôve been a disaster and that I wouldn‚Äôt remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.
Later that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.



The next day, the indoor gatherings continued. We went to the ‚Ä¶</p>

Is anyone familiar with any network topology visualizer libraries for the web?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:
1. The kinds of cookies I&#x27;m willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary&#x60; or &#x60;X-Prefer-Cookies: all&#x60;.
2. The fact that I don&#x27;t, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I&#x27;ll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: no&#x60;, or &#x60;X-Offer-Newsletter: yes&#x60;.
If you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like &#x60;X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters&#x60;.
This way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).
I think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)

I built it mostly under 24 hrs live on Twitter. Inspired by @sam_jetpack
Twitter thread: https://twitter.com/_justYogesh/...

üìå Currently, the job board only has around 23 jobs. Remote3 has a free listing and I would love to have jobs posted by the Producthunt community.

All widgets can be resized so you can fit different combinations on your phone screen based on what‚Äôs important to you. As you resize, your widgets will change. If you make your widgets bigger, you‚Äôll get more functionality (more space means we can squeeze in more useful features).

This blog post is about the implementation of DevTools support for debugging Content Security Policy (CSP) issues with the help of the recently introduced Issues tab.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">http://kck.st/3Gr93ne - and would üíñ the support if you resonate with this project and idea.

Additionally, if you have any feedback for this project or want me to build something for you to track a specific item that you really value let me know in the comments, and let&#x27;s start a conversation around it! Maybe I can help.

Here is the timeline for the product

- Tracker service for the Nintendo OLED and popular GPUs (1 - 2 months)
- Item tracker tips wiki (1 - 2 months)
- Tracker service for other sought after items coming from user interviews (3 - 6 months)
- Fully automated item purchaser service (6 - 12 months)
- Improving the services to be as quick, fair, and secure as possible (1 - 2 years)

Thank you for reading this far if you have, hope you have a great day regardless of whether you support this project!

Warm regards,
~ Mihai

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">https://gohighbrow.com/portfolio...) and since I am mainly a developer I wanted to put my learnings into an API for other developers to enjoy.

This is the result of that, I&#x27;m happy to hear feedback and maybe even ideas of what endpoints would be fun to have (pun intended).

Thanks for checking it out!

And now Open Graph images.
Get a sneak peek at an early version of the Eleventy API Explorer.
Open Graph images are those little pictures that show up when your site is shared on social media. I made the ones on my site better recently.
And while it was nice to have some prettier things displaying on social media‚ÄîI wanted to reuse the visuals on my own web site too. So, I built an image service that would find the Open Graph images for a web page.
I‚Äôm now using it on my home page:
The image service:
Takes a URL
Looks at the markup for that URL and finds the Open Graph image in use
Resizes and optimizes the image
Returns the result

The article is based on a single self selected study of 80 individuals sourced from Get The L Out, a group who, prior to the survey, were already united by anti-trans views.
This study breaks the BBC‚Äôs own guidelines about using surveys as sources for claims in coverage, as it is self-selected, with a small sample size and a clear bias held by those self-selected to respond.
The article dangerously frames this as a widespread issue, whilst simultaneously acknowledging that there is no actual evidence to that effect outside of isolated claims and cherry picked individual cases.
The article routinely implies that transgender women are not women, uncritically quoting people who call transgender women men without at any point clarifying that this is ignoring their legal status as women in the UK.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Season three of the Clearleft podcast is done and dusted. I‚Äôm pretty happy with how the six episodes turned out.
Episode one
Coaching. There was one question at the heart of this episode: what‚Äôs the difference between training, coaching, and mentoring? I got some great answers to that question, with some good stories along the way.
Episode two
Design Engineering. It will come as no surprise that I really enjoyed this episode. This is a topic I think is growing in importance. The relevation for me was the way Trys framed it less as the intersection between design and development, and more about the gap between design and development. And remember we‚Äôre looking for a design engineer to join Clearleft.
Episode three

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The EyeDropper API is part of the capabilities project and is currently
in development. This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. 


What is the EyeDropper API? #
Many creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the
entire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.
Photoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don&#x27;t have to guess a color
and risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,
useful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper
you can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don&#x27;t have to remember or copy the
color code from somewhere else.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My kids hold beef. And they hold it forever. If one kid in the neighborhood did something they‚Äôll talk about it every other day like it happened yesterday. The friend‚Äôs neighbor who is slightly younger but was annoying once? Annoying forever! Even if you‚Äôve played with him since! That new friend who said she saw a dinosaur in her backyard? A liar. Forever.
I don‚Äôt get it. I try to counsel them out of their beef. Maybe that girl who saw the dinosaur was just pretending, she has a big imagination (and that‚Äôs good!), or maybe someone in a dinosaur suit really ran thru the yard. I have one hundred potential scenariors for why she might have said that. We don‚Äôt know. And it doesn‚Äôt matter, because first of all, seeing a dinosaur sounds bad ass, so why not say it.
Oh, but they‚Äôll undo my words and Wormtongue each other the next day saying ‚ÄúBut remember that time‚Ä¶‚Äù
I don‚Äôt get it. I don‚Äôt see myself as a beef holder. Not forever anyways. My wife isn‚Äôt a beef holder either. She‚Äôs one of the most pleasant people I know. Who taught these kids to hold beef? From whomst was the beef holding begotten? Why hold beef forever? It goes bad. Let the beef go, kid.</p>

 If you were around then, and you had the pleasure of connecting to the web on a dial-up modem, you might remember what a silly and magical thing the web was. I can remember older people telling me it was ‚Äújust a fad‚Äù while thinking ‚Äúthis is the future.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the last three years, Chrome has been working to empower web applications that want to push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible in the browser. One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.
In this post, we&#x27;d like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web. You can use all the APIs Adobe used and more in your own apps as well. Be sure to check out our web capabilities related blog posts for inspiration and watch our API tracker for the latest and greatest we&#x27;re working on.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I don‚Äôt work with CSS much, but whenever I do, I‚Äôm continually blown away by how much easier modern CSS is now than it was five years ago.
I was working on a side-project this weekend, and the :not() pseudo-selector made my life a lot easier!
What the :not() pseudo-selector does The :not() pseudo-selector lets you select elements, but exclude ones that match an additional set of selectors. Pass in the selectors to ignore as an argument.</p>

            >Ask HN: Language design to mitigate supply chain attacks?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?
Background: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn&#x27;t written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).
A few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can&#x27;t &quot;takeover&quot; a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Images are a common source of performance bottlenecks for web applications and a key focus area for optimization. Unoptimized images contribute to page bloat and currently account for over 70% of the total page weight in bytes at the 90th percentile. Multiple ways to optimize images call for an intelligent &quot;image component&quot; with performance solutions baked in as a default.
The Aurora team worked with Next.js to build one such component. The goal was to create an optimized image template that web developers could further customize. The component serves as a good model and sets a standard for building image components in other frameworks, content management systems (CMS), and tech-stacks. We have collaborated on a similar component for Nuxt.js, and we are working with Angular on image optimi‚Ä¶</p>

            >Ask HN: Is starting a web design and hosting business viable today?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi everyone,
I and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).
She is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I&#x27;m currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I&#x27;m getting more and more bored every day.
However, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I&#x27;m not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I&#x27;ve done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.
Is there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Do you find yourself designing screens with only a vague idea of how the things on the screen relate to the things elsewhere in the system? Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight. When it comes to asking for more direct contact with your users, you might feel like poor Oliver Twist, timidly asking, ‚ÄúPlease, sir, I want some more.‚Äù¬†
Here‚Äôs the trick. You need to get stakeholders themselves to identify high-risk assumptions and hidden complexity, so that they become just as motivated as you to get answers from users. Basically, you need to make them think it‚Ä¶</p>

After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.
What is the right direction? Well‚Ä¶ the answer is: Prototypes.
Mark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn‚Äôt any fun. Mark said it felt shallow, repetitive, and dull. In his own words:
It comes down to making two very wrong assumptions. Assumption #1 is the game always felt kind of cool in my head, so I just kind of assumed the game wo‚Ä¶</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 96 beta was released on October 21, 2021 and is expected to become the
stable version in late November, 2021.
# The &quot;basic-card&quot; method of PaymentRequest API
The PaymentRequest API has deprecated the basic card payment
method. Its usage is low
and declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in
time-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment
methods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung
Pay.
# Removal timeline
Chrome 96
The basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.
Chrome 100
The basic-card method will be removed.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            >Auto Dark Theme</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome 96 introduces an Origin Trial for Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to light themed sites,
when the user has opted into dark themes in the Operating System.
Users can opt-out of dark themes by either disabling the option on the OS level or in a specific setting in Chrome.
# Sign-up for the Origin Trial
You can also enable the darkening algorithm for your users, via an Origin Trial.
This will allow you to test how the Auto Dark Theme performs with regards to your KPIs.
Head over to the documentation to learn
how to set up an Origin Trial,
then sign-up for the AutoDarkMode origin trial to get a token.

Way back in 2012, my cofounder Fred (fredsters_s) and I got into YC with one idea in mind, but soon pivoted once we saw a pattern among most of the other companies in our cohort.
These startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality.

We‚Äôre a team of people with varying backgrounds; spec authors, browser vendors, implementors, and normie practitioners like myself. Open UI is a community group so we can‚Äôt technically make HTML (for legal reasons), but we can present research to the W3C working groups. I see Open UI as an ad hoc research arm for the W3C with specific experience in design systems and common web componentry.
The ‚ÄúTabvengers‚Äù as we‚Äôre known, have produced a couple research documents and experiments so far:
Research  documenting a lot of the common parts and features of tabs; an interface inventory across a matrix of design systems and implementations

            >Ask HN: How to design a back in stock notification system?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I want to design a back in stock notification email service, where the users can sign up on the out-of-stock page and get notified when the item is back in stock.
If I have the list of users subscribed to back in stock alert and another table that has latest stock availability, what would be the best appraoch to build an efficient system that looks at these data and trigger back in stock email ?
- Do I poll the stock table for change in stock and then compare with user table and trigger email ? 
- Is there any other better ways of doing it ? Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.
I am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.

The other mindset is rare indeed. Do things that might not work. Develop new assertions. Go past the edges to unexplored territory. Try to figure out why things are the way they are. [‚Ä¶]</p>

no, you didn‚Äôt miss an edition, I just failed to write again. The struggles of writing WDRL lately made me think and write down something but so far I have no conclusion on how it‚Äôll go on. A few ideas are in my mind already. But autumn in full progress here in Germany, I found some time to read through articles and technologies and here is an edition mostly showing nice CSS solutions but also a couple of things to think about.

            >Optimizing resource loading with Priority Hints</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When a browser parses a web page and begins to discover and download resources such as images, scripts, or CSS, it assigns them a fetch priority in an attempt to download resources in an optimal order. These priorities can depend on the kind of resource and where it is in the document. For example, in-viewport images may have a High priority while the priority for early 
 loaded, render-blocking CSS in the 
 could be Very High. Browsers are pretty good at assigning priorities that work well but may not be optimal in all cases.
In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss Priority Hints and the importance attribute, which allow you to hint at the relative importance of a resource (high or low). Priority Hints can help optimize the Core Web Vitals.

And‚Ä¶ it works! If you‚Äôre wondering why I made this, the tl;dr is that Sass has a superior way of adjusting the alpha channel on ANY COLOR (rgb, hsl, named color, etc) but that does not work with CSS Custom Properties. This little paint worklet restores that flavor of color manipulation to backgrounds and borders. Here‚Äôs a video with a more in-depth explanation:

# Routing with URLPattern
Nearly all web apps depend on routing in some way whether it&#x27;s code running
on a server that maps a path to files on disk or logic in a single-page app
that updates the DOM when the URL changes. URLPattern is a new web
platform API that standardizes routing pattern syntax.

            >Ask HN: How do you design UI components?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi HN,
I have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.
For my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.
The most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.
That could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.
But I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 &quot;blobs&quot; on it that represent min, max and most likely.
The advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.
I then went on Google to see if there is any research to &quot;Designing Components&quot; but I&#x27;m kinda overwhelmed by &quot;top 10 UI/UX component&quot; answers and MATERIAL.
So I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?

catch some of these errors‚è§such as security violations or deprecated and soon-to-be-deprecated API

The Reporting API informs you about errors that happen across your site as visitors use it. It gives
you visibility on browser interventions, browser crashes, Content-Security-Policy violations,
COOP/COEP violations, deprecation warnings and more.
A new version of the Reporting API is available. The new API is leaner and more likely to be
supported across browsers.
The legacy Reporting API is named Reporting API v0. The new Reporting API is named

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Scala compiler is a fascinating tool which powers a large proportion of the Guardian‚Äôs infrastructure. But sometimes the work that it does can seem somewhat mysterious. Guardian Scala developer Paul Roberts explores in detail one aspect of this mystery and looks at how understanding it can help us write code more effectively
Scala is the programming language which underpins many of the most important tools which allow the Guardian to deliver its journalism. And when compared to other languages, Scala has a lot of wonderful tools for making your code simpler. However, sometimes this is achieved by hiding a lot of the complexity. Usually this is a good thing ‚Äì it‚Äôs the compiler writer‚Äôs problem and we have the luxury of just being able to ignore it and get on with what we are trying to do. But occasionally it can actually influence the way our code is running and as a result, present us with surprises.
To have something to work with, I began playing around with solutions to Project Euler problem 39 (spoilers for problems after 100 are discouraged but this one is OK).
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p &#x3D; 120.

This talk had two major objectives. Firstly, In January 2021 I joined the W3C Web Components Community Group, which is hoping to advance Web Components and raise awareness. It‚Äôs a worthwhile cause to get over some of Web Components‚Äô historical marketing problems. I also get a chance to provide feedback on nascent stage proposals. I‚Äôm a fringe member in this group, but happy to escalate any questions or feedback you have.
The second reason I wanted to talk about Web Components is that I feel there‚Äôs an education gap.  I noticed that nearly all the people I know that love HTML, CSS, and Design System‚Ä¶</p>

Cleo didn‚Äôt show up. Foiled! I thought she always went to this thing. Ugh. Okay. Reset. I made due, grabbed a plat of free BBQ and sat down. I was now on my own in a sea of retirees running the same free BBQ grift I was running. There were two people under 60: my financial advisor and the person he invited to be the guest speaker. I failed at making small talk, so my tablemates and I sat the long table poking at our meats and the conversation centered around passing the potato salad.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This week I came across an article titled ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt video games take sex seriously?‚Äù‚Ä¶ so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I‚Äôm a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he‚Äôs a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I‚Äôm not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang‚Äôs work.

// Split the text content into an array, using spaces to break words // Use Array.filter() to remove any words without a length // (this removes double spaces in the content) let words &#x3D; text.value.split(&#x27; &#x27;).filter(function (word) { return word.length; });  One of my students has a solution that looks like this.</p>

It‚Äôs incredible to me the variability effect that your hardware can have: from a 64 on Performance to a 94‚Äîthat‚Äôs a thirty point swing!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it‚Äôs sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.
Episode six is all about design principles. That‚Äôs a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.
But for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.
Katie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite‚Äôs time for her to talk me through it. I‚Äôve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.
It‚Äôs nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.

And with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!</p>

For this virtual hack day of 2021, we had a dedicated focus: Cop26 and the environment. The recent IPCC report makes for grim reading which is why we decided to focus our attention on developing new interactive tools for our readers to stay informed. We produced and presented 19 amazing hacks over the two-day event, including a tool to read product ingredients and determine if they are vegan or not, a visualisation of the world showing data about temperature changes over the last century, an app for extending the life of all your belongings and keeping them out of landfill and an app that uses data from waqi.io to provide the quality of air by location. Below is a selection of the best concepts and designs from the event.

Before working on the Blink team,
I was a front-end engineer (before Google had the role of &quot;front-end engineer&quot;),
building features within Google Docs, Drive, and Gmail.
After around five years in that role I took a large gamble switching to the Blink team,
effectively learning C++ on the job,
and attempting to ramp up on the massively complex Blink codebase.
Even today, I only understand a relatively small portion of it.

What is a service worker? A service worker is a special type of JavaScript file that acts like middleware for your site.
Any request that comes from the site and any response it gets back first goes through the service worker file.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">If you&#x27;ve used connection throttling in the network panel in a browser&#x27;s developer tools (or Lighthouse in Chrome) to assess loading performance, you know how convenient those tools are for performance tuning. You can quickly measure the impact of performance optimizations with a consistent and stable baseline connection speed. The only problem is that this is synthetic testing, which yields lab data, not field data.
Synthetic testing isn&#x27;t inherently bad, but it&#x27;s not representative of how fast your website is loading for real users. That requires field data, which you can collect from the Navigation Timing and Resource Timing APIs.

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I‚Äôm particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.
Some highlights‚Ä¶

The big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It‚Äôs thrice weekly‚Äôish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel. I wrote a bit about it, but Chris and I are having a good time making videos. We‚Äôre up to 12 videos so far. That‚Äôs a helluva cadence so there‚Äôll be some breaks, but so far feels pretty sustainable.

Let‚Äôs dig in!
Using the Array.splice() method The Array.splice() method accepts three arguments: start, delete, and items.
The first, start, is the index of the item you want to modify in the array. It‚Äôs the only required argument.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn‚Äôt support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#x27; lives easier.

When Roberto was 10 years old, he went to the library with his dad. There was a little computer in the corner that caught his interest and he left with every book on computing he could find. At home, Roberto took out a pad of paper and started writing his first code. Years later, when Roberto decided he probably couldn‚Äôt follow his original dream of being a mathematician, he decided to pursue a career in computing.
What was the path that eventually brought you to the Guardian?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A new episode of the Clearleft podcast just dropped and I have to say, this is one of my favourites so far. It‚Äôs all about measuring design.
There was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn‚Äôt there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?
For this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.
This episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it‚Äôs well worth your time. Have a listen.

This is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Applications deal with untrusted strings all the time, but safely rendering that content as part of an HTML document can be tricky. Without sufficient care, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally create opportunities for cross-site scripting (XSS) that malicious attackers may exploit.
To mitigate that risk, the new Sanitizer API proposal aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page. This article introduces the API, and explains its usage.
// Expanded Safely !!
$div.setHTML(&#x60;hello world&#x60;, new Sanitizer())
Escaping user input #
When inserting user input, query strings, cookie contents, and so on, into the DOM, the strings must be escaped properly. Particular attention should be paid to DOM manipulation via .innerHTML, where‚Ä¶</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Bootstrap v5.1.2 is here with a handful of improvements across our components, plus a fix for an issue in another project that prevented our Sass from compiling properly. Keep reading for the highlights.
Highlights
Temporarily patched a postcss-values-parser issue by rearranging our calc() functions that use negative numbers. This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap‚Äôs Sass in create-react-app.
Added border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects
Added align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers
Fixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children
Updated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN
Improved docs around .img-fluid
Added role&#x3D;&quot;switch&quot; to our form switches in our docs
Implemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.
Up next
Up next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we‚Äôll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It‚Äôs also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap

            >Best practices for using third-party embeds</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Many sites use third-party embeds to create an engaging user experience by delegating some sections of a web page to another content provider. The most common examples of third-party content embeds are video players, social-media feeds, maps, and advertisements.
Third-party content can impact the performance of a page in many ways. It can be render-blocking, contend with other critical resources for network and bandwidth, or affect the Core Web Vitals metrics. Third-party embeds may also cause layout shifts as they load. This article discusses performance best practices that you can use when loading third-party embeds, efficient loading techniques, and the Layout Shift Terminator tool that helps reduce layout shifts for popular embeds.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">@peperomioides .

We started Matter because reading online is still a frustrating experience!

While our other tools have improved over time‚Äìwith more powerful functionality, social features, and seamless interfaces‚Äìreading is largely the same as it‚Äôs been for the past few decades.

Matter is a read-it-later app built for today‚Äôs internet. It treats creators, newsletters, and alternative media as first-class citizens. It‚Äôs social. And it uses modern technology ‚Äì from parsing to speech synthesis ‚Äì to deliver a more magical reading experience.

We just launched Matter to public beta after a year and a half of development (iOS only for now), and we‚Äôre delighted to share it with the Product Hunt community.

We‚Äôd love to hear your feedback! Feel free to drop a comment below or email me anytime at ben@getmatter.app.

Previous episodes
In C++, ruling out the possibility of data races comes down to a small thread-safety correctness proof for every data member access.
These proofs add up to a lot of mental toil, especially when reviewing or refactoring code.
Clang&#x27;s static analysis framework takes over the toil of thread-safety proofs.
# Add GUARDED_BY_CONTEXT() to data members in thread-unsafe classes
Most Chrome classes are thread-unsafe, and should be used on a single sequence.
Add annotations to all data members that are not thread-safe.
Unnecessary annotations are safe, but missing annotations are a risk of data races.
#include &quot;base/sequence_checker.h&quot;  // for SEQUENCE_CHECKER()
#include &quot;base/thread_annotations.h&quot;  // for GUARDED_BY_CONTEXT()

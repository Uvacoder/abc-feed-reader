          <p>There are so many books and resources titled Design Patterns in X language but all of them seem to be teaching it in a way that aren&#x27;t ideal in a practical situation.
Most of them just look like the language was used like Java style Gang of Four or Head First Design Patterns.
Are there any books that teach design patterns without either relying on a language or using the language specific idioms correctly?

But that doesn’t mean that people are interested. We each have a noise in our heads, an agenda and something urgent that’s grabbing our attention. And so, the amount of interest […]</p>

          <p>Hey!
I’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.
Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.
This can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is
Measuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.
What are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?

Packaging plays a significant role in selling a product when it is done creatively and correctly. There’s more to promotional products than applying a logo to a box or creating a fancy label. Consumers are attracted to it, and it communicates a message.
In most cases, the packaging is used to protect products. Now packaging design is diverse. Although most packaging is designed to keep products safe, others help brands stand out and entertain customers. It can be why a customer tries a product for the first time.
Whether it’s clean, muted colors or whimsical details that lighten the mood, the designs customers gravitate towards these days show the impact creative packaging has on their buying decisions.

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Although Y2K itself was popular between 1995 and 2004, we will focus on designs from the early 2000s. In fact, since looks come into fashion again after about twenty years, we’re right on schedule!
The Y2K looks emphasize technology and futuristic looks, mainly in the form of shiny skin-tight clothes and silver-blue eyeshadow. During this time, technology such as Windows 95, PlayStation, and N64 were at their peak. Pokemon had just been released in Japan and the Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys were sweeping the nation. These years played a crucial role in the culture of 30 somethings around the globe.

          <p>Hi HN,
while building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.
So, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.
The first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.
We are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.
Cheerz :)

          <p>Today we are excited to launch a set of new, powerful features and functionality for all users of WebPageTest to help make it faster and easier for you and your teams to make sense of your website’s performance, the opportunities for improvement, and, critically, how significant those opportunities are.

One of the goals that has guided our changes to WebPageTest in the past few years is to close the gap between “uh oh, something’s wrong” to “I know what I need to do to fix this.”

          <p>I have spent a few years banging on about ensuring scrolling areas on a page are accessible to keyboard-only users. This is partly because the term “keyboard” maps to other input types that we distill to “keyboard” for ease of reference (speech input, sip-and-puff, on-screen keyboards, scanning software, etc.).

          <p>Hello HN! Author here :)
I&#x27;ve finished upgrading the Hacker News reading app that I made sometime earlier.
Among previous features, I added some new ones - which include:
- the ability to bookmark any story or comment, which you can read later, and   the newly added comments are highlighted (the ones you did not see or read earlier);
- the ability to search through comments, and find the one that you are interested in;
- the ability to reply to comments (but you must be logged in at original news.ycombinator.com website to do so).
The app is using offical HN API to get the data, and it&#x27;s client side rendered.
The technologies used for making this web app are: React (Router, Redux) and vanilla CSS.
Let me know what you think about the app in the comments.
Thanks!

That means that if you’ve been struggling to work together over the internet, it might be high time to upgrade your collaboration methods.

We talk to Zach Leatherman, creator and maintainer of Eleventy, about Eleventy, what it was like to be acquired by Netlify, and how Eleventy reached 3 million downloads on npm.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31562460 target="_blank">Ask HN: Are JS bundlers filling a design flaw?</a>
          <p>I don’t have a lot of experience in Node development. From a glance, my idea of a bundler is a utility that takes code from software packages and assembles it with autogenerated boilerplates to produce front end applications that can run without any backend dependence.
From looking at a few, my concern is they are inherently bloated and fill a gap that really shouldn’t exist.
Shouldn’t JS client code be assembled with packages as a standard, something that compiles together without all this filler nonsense?
These things typically produce tens of thousands of lines just to add simple libraries.

          <p>Sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like working. Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn&#x27;t have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.
How do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?
Maybe it&#x27;s just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.
I&#x27;m wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.

          <p>I enjoyed this article by Jeremy Keith on writing alt text for images. In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an . It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).
As a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.

          <p>How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?
Examples of experiments:
 - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.
 - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.
 - Try intermittent fasting.
 - Start writing tests first (TDD).
I wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the &quot;scientific method&quot; on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.

          <p>Mine: overlay on video (especially when they&#x27;re not full screened).
They&#x27;re often too obstructive for no reason (often has a too large dark gradient that blocks bottom or top of the video), takes forever to disappear, and hard to operate (very easy to accidentally pause the video). For example, CC button for YouTube: it totally could be below the video element.
This is especially annoying on mobile since there is not keyboard shortcuts.

          <p>Supply chains are still struggling from Covid, China lock downs, war, shipping rate increases, port backlogs, no fab capacity, etc.  Component lead times are long, if not impossible to get.

          <p>In Austin we have three types of trash: trash, recycling, and compost. And then if I’m honest there’s a fourth and fifth variety: e-waste and a bag of old clothes and toys to donate.

          <p>I know I’m not alone in browsing hacker news on my phone.
On mobile devices the flag/hide buttons are super close to the article and comment links. I hit them all the time unintentionally.
Maybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?
I have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.

Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, many designers, artists, and illustrators strive to improve their drawing and sketching skills. So we have compiled a surefire list of five tips that will help you to improve your drawing skills right away.
Before starting, the first step should be to decide what your drawing goals are.

# Block external protocol in sandboxed iframes
Sandboxed iframes are not blocked from opening external applications. Currently, developers sandbox untrusted content and block user navigation. Blocking probably should have also included links to external apps or to the Play store. This has now been fixed.
Sites that need navigation can add the following values to the  element&#x27;s sandbox property:

          <p>CHIPS is a Privacy
Sandbox proposal that introduces a mechanism to opt-in to having third-party
cookies partitioned by top-level site using a new cookie attribute,
Partitioned.
The experiment started in Chrome 100 on March 29, 2022 and was scheduled to run
until June 14, 2022.
To give developers more time to test the feature and gather more feedback, an
extension to the experiment will run through Chrome 104 until the release of Chrome 105, on August 30, 2022.
Starting in version 103, Chrome will include an alternative CHIPS origin trial design for HTTP
cookies, which should enable an opt-in mechanism that will make deployment
easier for large organizations.
In the new design, sending Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Partitioned-Cookies header will
no longer be required to enroll in the origin trial. Sites will only need to
send the Origin-Trial header with their CHIPS origin trial token when they are sending
responses that include the Set-Cookie header with the Partitioned
attribute.
To enroll in the origin trial and start experimenting, head over to
CHIPS origin trial instructions.</p>

          <p>Up until the latest redesign of the Bootstrap documentation, our blog and Icons sites were including Bootstrap’s compiled CSS and JavaScript via CDN. This worked great overall and gave, but I found myself needing and wanting more granular control over the final production assets. In particular, I wanted the source Sass files, but just the compiled JS for now. Despite using Hugo for years now in Bootstrap’s docs, I’m a complete Hugo newbie, so I had no idea how to actually include Bootstrap with npm in a Hugo project. So I set out to fix that.
The solution I used is straightforward, but I didn’t see many clear and concise answers on it outside some forum threads: use the Hugo mounts system. So, after you create your package.json and npm i bootstrap, you setup your Hugo config to pull from t…</p>

          <p>A decade ago HTML and CSS added the ability to, at least signal, validation of form fields. The required attribute helped inform users which fields were required, while pattern allowed developers to provide a regular expression to match against an &lt;input&gt;‘s value. Targeting required fields and validation values with just CSS and HTML was very […]

          <a href=https://tamagui.dev/?hn target="_blank">Show HN: Tamagui – An optimizing compiler for better React Native and Web UI</a>
          <p>Trying submitting again. Previously shown here[0], Tamagui is now in beta.
Tamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.
All of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.
I think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a &#x60;size&#x60; prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.

          <p>There are tons of conflicting opinions on the best approach to architecting and designing large scale software. I&#x27;d love to hear some anecdotes for what&#x27;s really worked in the real world.
Bonus points if the pattern was used in a large scale web app with multiple clients and a common backend api.

          <p>I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?
Obviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.
To test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase &quot;survey&quot; engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.
Love to hear your thoughts and feedback: https://tuun.app/
Best,
 Soheil

Something that could jeopardize that is a bad client. But do you always get to choose whom you work with?
We’ve all heard those client horror stories and it’s likely you have a few of your own. Late payments, ghosting, driving the price down, unrealistic deadlines etc, the list goes on.
Working with assholes is all part of the territory, right?

          <p>I know there is no alternative to having actualy experiencing designing and coding software by working at a company like Aamzon or Spotify but if you are stuck at a B2B enterprise company you barely deal with complex challenges at scale and distributed system. At a senior (Staff/Pricipal) level its a deadlock between getting into a roll which does it and learning hands on. Guess &quot;Design a uber&quot; design questions in yourtube is not enough. Any comprehensive resources or habit that can help ?

If you’re a Marvel fan, you’ve probably watched most of the movies or TV shows in their collection—especially Phase Four. You might know all of the characters, the crazy Reddit theories, and you can’t wait for the new Thor: Love and Thunder.
Now think about your friends—the ones that are not into Marvel or maybe just watch it because it’s popular and they love going to the movie theater. I’m going to assume you know a few of these people. I know I do. Here’s the thing: When talking about The Avengers, I noticed most of them recognize names like Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow.

          <p>We are thrilled to have the first round of tooling support for the new experimental responsiveness metric, Interaction to Next Paint (INP). To learn about the metric itself, check out the official INP metric guide.
# Suggested measurement
The goal of measuring INP is to understand how fast your page responds to user input. The only way to get realistic data is to measure how your page is responding for real users visiting your site using data from the field.
Measuring INP in the lab then helps to better understand event timings and where optimizations need to happen. Lab tools won&#x27;t automatically interact with the page, so they either need manual input while they measure, or they need to be scripted with an automation tool like Puppeteer. When key interactions are identified from typical u…</p>

          <p>I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:
- forums
- Blogger/Wordpress
- personal portfolio sites
- YouTube for tutorial videos
- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr
- Gumroad for digital products
None of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.
I want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.
Why is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?

          <p>The paradox of most tightly-knit communities is that they have an internal culture. And that culture often makes it difficult for a new person to join. It’s hard to have insiders if you don’t have outsiders. This is true for guilds of copy editors, fans of anime or branches of science. The key transition point […]</p>

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.0-beta1 added a slew of CSS custom properties, or CSS variables, across the :root level and all our core components. Here’s a quick look at how you can utilize them in your projects.
With CSS variables, you can now customize Bootstrap easier than ever, and without the need for a CSS preprocessor. All the power of Sass is still there behind the scenes, but CSS variables adds a ton of power for the future. Use and compose new values, updates styles globally without recompiling, set fallback values, setup new color modes, and more.
Let’s dig in.
CSS variables?
Their official name is custom properties, but they’re often referred to as CSS variables thanks to their most immediate use case for setting specific values. Consider reading the MDN CSS custom properties article or the C…</p>

          <p>Did you know, if you use CSS math functions like min(), max() and clamp() and you’re calculating any one of the arguments, you don’t need calc()? I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.
So if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);
}
You can do this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);
}
It totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!
It works with custom properties too — check out this demo.
Incidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.</p>

          <p>I realized that I have more respect for the development profession then I do for designers and I am trying to figure out why. Businesses seem to respect both enough to pay large amounts of money for the work, and people out side of the tech space don&#x27;t seem to care either way. I have alternated between the two fields for ~10 years and have ran into UX and Devs who phone it in, and who act like professionals, but the professional craft seems more common in development.

Two years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.
You see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” &#x3D; yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” &#x3D; yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.8.2 has arrvied with some bug fixes and a refreshed docs design to match our main project.
Here’s a quick rundown on the icon fixes:
Fix cutoff bank icon
Fix house-heart and house-heart-fill fill-rules
Fix corners of pentagon icons to match other shapes
Fix fill-rule for x-lg
Fix cutoff tool icon
On the CSS side, we’ve also added font-display: block to help address our icon font affecting Google Lighthouse scores.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

          <p>It’s the biggest release since v5 itself—Bootstrap v5.2.0-beta1 is here! This release features redesigned docs, CSS variables for all our components, responsive offcanvas, new helpers and utilities, refined buttons and inputs, and lots of improvements under the hood.
Given the size of the update and time since our last release, we’re doing something different and shipping it as a beta first. Keep reading for details.
Why so long?
I want to start by acknowledging the time it’s taken to ship a new release. As an open source maintainer, I’m constantly worried about not doing or being good enough of a developer for my projects. Pair that with a distributed team all working through this pandemic and me having a heart attack, we’ve all needed some down time. I managed to put together a Bootstrap…</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/private-prefetch-proxy/ target="_blank">Private prefetch proxy in Chrome</a>
          <p>Since Chrome 92, we&#x27;ve been running an Early Access Program (EAP) for a feature called Private Prefetch Proxy, which speeds up outgoing navigations from Google Search by 30% at the median. Private Prefetch Proxy allows the prefetching of cross-origin content without exposing user information to the destination website until the user navigates. We expect that the feature will graduate from this EAP as early as Chrome 103, thereby no longer requiring websites to opt-in, and allowing other referrer websites to safely speed up cross-site navigations.
Read on to learn about how this feature works,
how it can help significantly improve your sites&#x27; Largest Contentful Paint (LCP),
or how referrer websites can help their users achieve their goals by speeding up cross-site navigations.

          <p># Why does page load speed matter?
Most users routinely identify slow page loads as a major source of frustration (54% in a user study conducted by Google). So, it should not come as a surprise that faster page loads result in better outcomes for a business. Indeed, if visitors get frustrated even before they interact with a website, it&#x27;s very unlikely that they will stay long enough to appreciate its value. In fact, another Google study across 254 eCommerce, finance, and travel sites showed that sites which load in two seconds or less had 15% higher conversion rates.

As the saying goes, you can&#x27;t improve what you don&#x27;t measure. For user experiences on the web, we believe that Core Web Vitals constitute a solid set of user-centric metrics design…</p>

# Preview feature: New Performance insights panel
Use the Performance insights panel to get actionable and use-case-driven insights on your website&#x27;s performance.
Open the panel and start a new recording based on your use case. For example, let’s measure the page load of this demo page.
Once the recording is complete, you get the performance insights on the  Insights pane. Click on each insight item (for example, Render blocking request, layout shift) to understand the issue and potential fixes.
Go to the Performance insights panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial.

At Chrome Dev Summit 2020, we demoed Chrome&#x27;s debugging support for WebAssembly applications on the web for the first time. Since then, the team has invested a lot of energy into making the developer experience scale for large and even huge applications. In this post we will show you the knobs we added (or made work) in the different tools and how to use them!
# Scalable debugging
Let&#x27;s pick up where we left off in our 2020 post. Here is the example we were looking at back then:
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  // Init SDL.
  int width &#x3D; 600, height &#x3D; 600;
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);

          <p>I&#x27;ve finally become proficient with Tailwind CSS.
However, my sites still look ok. I&#x27;ve adopted the idea of &quot;use different shades gray to make UIs&quot; and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.
Consider sites like:
- https://curius.app/
- https://www.notion.so/
- https://www.focusmate.com/
These sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn&#x27;t help me make my site look... human.
I feel like I need a &quot;design palette&quot; instead of a mere &quot;color/margin palette&quot;. What&#x27;s the recommendation for this?

          <p>One of the things we want to do when trying to make our websites faster is to have content appear on screen as quickly as possible. It’s something that metrics such as First and Largest Contentful Paint try to measure.
To achieve faster paint times, we often want to try and prioritise content requests like fonts and images. While we can do a lot by ourselves to optimise these resources, there are times when even our best efforts can sometimes be undone by third-party requests that block the browser from rendering content.
In this post, we’ll cover:
What are render-blocking resources?
How can render-blocking third-party requests hurt a site’s performance?

          <p>One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.
Take color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.

The rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.
In design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel…</p>

          <p>The web platform now ships with Capture Handle, a mechanism that helps collaboration between capturing and captured web apps. Capture Handle allows a capturing web app to ergonomically and confidently identify the captured web app. (If the captured web app has opted-in.)
A few examples illustrate the benefits.
Example 1: If a video conferencing web app is capturing a presentation web app, the video conferencing web app can expose controls to the user for navigating between slides. Because the controls are embedded directly in the video conferencing web app, the user doesn’t have to repeatedly switch between the video conferencing tab and the presented tab. With this burden lifted, the user is now free to concentrate more fully on the delivery of their presentation.

The web is now more capable than ever, enabling developers to bring to the web highly capable applications such as Photoshop.
Though the Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, we&#x27;re responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend on countless others in the community who have built a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools, demonstration apps, and other materials. To help recognize the importance of this work and to enable more people to spend time on these projects, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce today the launch of the Advanced Web Apps Fund: a new fund to support the web a…</p>

          <p>Some situations seem to call for an opponent. It might be our personality, the structure of the engagement or the way we’ve been taught to behave, but having an enemy seems to focus individuals and groups.

          <p>Hey,
this week’s links are quite interesting: A couple of web standard (proposals) that would make CSS easier again like CSS Toggles, easy progressive enhancement for form data using the web platform. But also things like a huge list of JavaScript concepts to enhance your knowledge, or simple multi-select fields without a UI library. And then, self-hosted apps seem to become more popular again as rally or planby, two open source planning/meeting/schedule tools show us. It’s always fun to collect the links for my newsletter and shows how diverse web development is. And finally, the tips from Kevin Kelly on how to see and live life are a great inspiration to become a calmer, nicer and more focused person valued in a community.

What makes you think that? It&#x27;s possible that your circumstances and mindset were holding you back.


In fact, our mindset accounts for 80% of our success and mechanics and circumstances account for 20%. Most people know enough to get the job done, but they don&#x27;t because their psychology is out of sync with their objectives.


You can&#x27;t guarantee success, but you can improve your chances. After all, chance favors the prepared. Here I am sharing 6 ways to increase the odds of success.

            >Ask HN: Is there a proper design pattern for this situation?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software&#x27;s API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.
I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I&#x27;m certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I&#x27;d like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.
The problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don&#x27;t see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.
In a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that&#x27;s not an option.
Is my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the spirit of December and the many calendars that folks use to countdown and celebrate, we wanted to highlight web content from the community and the Chrome team. Every day, we highlighted one piece of UI-development and design-related content, totaling 31 highlights, among which were 26 new demo sites, tools, announcements, podcasts, videos, articles, and case studies.
See the full experience at designcember.com.
Overview #
Our goal was to deliver an accessible, whimsical, modern, and responsive web experience in as few bytes as possible. We wanted to highlight new responsive APIs like container queries, and include a beautiful example of a dark mode in a design-focused and asset-heavy website. To achieve this, we compressed files, offered multiple formats, used build tools optimized …</p>

            >:has() Has Landed in Safari</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:
section:has(img) {
  background: lightgray;
}
But eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.
You could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:
form:has(input:invalid) {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
The parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.
It’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():
@supports selector(:has(*)) {
  .info,
  .warning {
    display: none;
  }
}
On a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Replacing a substring of text within a larger string has always been misleading in JavaScript. I wrote Replace All Occurrences of a String in JavaScript years ago and it’s still one of my most read articles. The confusion lies in that replace only replaces the first occurrence of a substring, not all occurrences. For example: […]

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. I want to say thank you to everyone here who reads or supports this project.
This year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time. But nature has helped me, my child has helped me, meditation and focusing on my own opinion, on my own body, on my own health helps me stayin…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 23, 2021 4:15 PM GMT

The &quot;biological anchors&quot; method for forecasting transformative AI is the biggest non-trust-based input into my thinking about likely timelines for transformative AI. While I&#x27;m sympathetic to parts of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s recent post on it, I overall disagree with the post, and think it&#x27;s easy to get a misimpression of the &quot;biological anchors&quot; report (which I&#x27;ll abbreviate as &quot;Bio Anchors&quot;) - and Open Philanthropy&#x27;s take on it - by reading it. 
This post has three sections:

Most of Eliezer&#x27;s critique seems directed at assumptions the report explicitly does not make about how transformative AI will be developed, and more broadly, about the connection between its (the report&#x27;s) compute estimates and all-things-considered AI timelines. One way of put…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The challenge #
I&#x27;m a kid of the 1980s. A thing that was all the rage back when I was in high school were solar
calculators. We were all given a
TI-30X SOLAR by the school,
and I have fond memories of us benchmarking our calculators against each other by calculating the
factorial of 69, the highest number the TI-30X could handle. (The speed variance was very
measurable, I have still no idea why.)
Now, almost 28 years later, I thought it would be a fun Designcember challenge to recreate the
calculator in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Being not much of a designer, I did not start from scratch,
but with a CodePen by
Sassja Ceballos.
Make it installable #
While not a bad start, I decided to pump it up for full skeuomorphic awesomeness. The first step was
to make it a PWA so it could be installed.…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This post is part of Designcember. A celebration of web design, brought to you by web.dev.
Miriam Suzanne is an author, artist, and web developer in Denver, Colorado. She’s a co-founder of OddBird (a web agency), staff writer for CSS Tricks, member of the Sass core team, and W3C Invited Expert on the CSS Working Group. Lately she&#x27;s been focused on developing new CSS features like Cascade Layers, Container Queries, and Scope. Offline, Miriam is a published novelist, playwright, and musician. We talked about her work with Sass and CSS.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The final four are here! The course on responsive design I wrote for web.dev is now complete, just in time for Christmas. The four new modules are:
Accessibility
User interface patterns
Media features
Screen configurations
These four felt quite “big picture”, and often quite future-facing. I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens. That felt like a fitting way to close out the course, bookending it nicely with the history of responsive design in the introduction.
And with that, the full course is now online. Go forth and learn responsive design!</p>

Were there builds of basically stock OpenStep 4.2 running on PPC Macs within Apple on the early days? Were there builds with the Rhapsody UI running on Intel only while the rest of the OS was still being ported? Were these both happening at the same time in the same codebase?
I figure someone on here should have some inside information ;)

            >How we manage programming projects in Basecamp</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">That we manage all our programming projects in Basecamp is perhaps an obvious admission since its our own product. But it&#x27;s less obvious to some how that&#x27;s possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can&#x27;t seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn&#x27;t tied together?
The simple answer is: don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That&#x27;…</p>

Quite often, I will make an agreement, and then find myself regretting it. I’ll commit to spending a certain amount of hours helping someone with their problem, or I’ll agree to take part in an outing or a party or a project, or I’ll trade some item for a certain amount of value in return, and then later find that my predictions about how I would feel were pretty far off, and I&#x27;m unhappy.
Sometimes, I just suck it up and stick it out. But sometimes I renege on the agreement. In this essay, I’d like to lay out a model for …</p>

Rising temperatures, increasingly extreme weather events, and the failure of this year’s COP26 conference to deliver strong leadership have all highlighted the urgency of reducing our emissions if we’re to avoid disastrous climate change. The commitments of world leaders may have fallen short, but we all have a role to play, and we can’t escape our responsibility.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I have just tried to get my access back to my bank account.
Since I switch numbers frequently due to moving countries, 2FA is hell for me.
To get my account back I need a selfie with both my face and ID visible. Very hard. Guess it&#x27;s due to security.
After some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.
Fear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.
Upload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.
The other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.
Am I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer? How do non techies cope?

            >Email is the antidote</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s easy to get down on the internet as a medium for reasoned debate. Every discussion on social media that touch controversial topics seems to descent into the depths of hell in less than sixty seconds. But social media is not the internet. It&#x27;s merely one distorted expression of it. There are other ways to connect, to reason, to learn. Like email!
I don&#x27;t just mean newsletters, though I love them dearly. In fact, I&#x27;d say the majority part part of my media diet now consists of newsletters. Both from the mastodons like The New York Times and Washington Post, but just as importantly from individual journalists and writers, like Matt Levine, Glenn Loury, Bari Weiss, Ben Thompson, Zaid Jilani, Andrew Sullivan, Bob Lefsetz, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Glenn Greenwald.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Could John McWhorter have gone on MSNBC or The View or PBS or NPR a year ago to talk about a new book called Woke Racism? Would a book with a title like that even have been welcome at that moment in such chambers? I doubt it.
But now it is. McWhorter has not only written an important book that&#x27;s rightfully garnering broad attention, he&#x27;s also secured an important platform by joining The New York Times as a columnist, and through these outlets, brought an oppositional argument to what five minutes ago were unassailable, widely adopted axioms of antiracism.
That&#x27;s both an incredible personal achievement for McWhorter, and an indication of how quickly sentiments can change. The religious fervor of &quot;woke&quot;, as McWhorter might put it, reached a stunning cultural dominance over the past year or t…</p>

.color-blue { color: blue; } .color-purple { color: rebeccapurple; } And you’ve got some HTML like this.

Yet, meetings do convey information, and we need to convey information, so what&#x27;s our replacement?
Writing. Long-form, complete-thought, considered writing. We write a lot at Basecamp.
Since long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they&#x27;re ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time. No synchronization of schedules required, no pulling people off their work to sit around a table (or show their face in a box on the screen), and none of the FOMO or stress that&#x27;s tied to real-time communication like group chat.
Long-form writing takes many forms at Basecamp, but &quot;Heartbeats&quot; are a prime example.

By Katey Chambers


With the new year quickly approaching, you might be starting to think about your health goals, such as losing weight, eating healthier, starting an exercise routine and/or finding ways to manage your stress. And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀


So what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them. Want to know the secret to actually sticking w…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 10, 2021 11:41 PM GMT

This is a high-level overview of the reasoning behind my research priorities, written as a Q&amp;A.
What’s your plan for AI alignment?
Step 1: sort out our fundamental confusions about agency
Step 2: ambitious value learning (i.e. build an AI which correctly learns human values and optimizes for them)
Step 3: …
Step 4: profit!
… and do all that before AGI kills us all.
That sounds… awfully optimistic. Do you actually think that’s viable?
Better than a 50/50 chance of working in time.
Do you just have really long timelines?
No. My median is maybe 10-15 years, though that’s more a gut estimate based on how surprised I was over the past decade rather than a carefully-considered analysis. (I wouldn’t be shocked by another AI winter, especially on an ins…</p>

In this article, we&#x27;ll analyze Terra&#x27;s journey from identifying the size of the &quot;dark mode&quot; cohort, to applying a custom dark theme, and finally measuring the impact of this implementation on their main KPIs.

What is dark mode? #
Historically user interfaces in devices are displayed in &quot;light mode&quot;, which usually means displaying black text on top of light interfaces. The alternative is &quot;dark mode&quot;, with light text on a dark background, such as gray or black.
Dark Mode has benefits for user experience.…</p>

 Unfortunately, Proxies are opaque. There’s no property you can look at or test you can do to determine if an object is already a proxy or not.
And that can lead to situations where you end up with proxies nested inside proxies nested inside proxies nested inside…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf.  In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.
This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.
All the talks are available to stream online.
Here’s a summary of what was shared on stage:

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The State of CSS 2021 survey ran for the third year in a row, and reached over 8,000 developers worldwide. Let&#x27;s  look at some of the results and how they map to plans browsers have for adding CSS features in 2022.
Feature usage and awareness
For some features, there&#x27;s a clear trend in usage and awareness year-over-year. CSS grid is an example of this.
This matches the trend for CSS Grid in the 2021 Web Almanac and in Chrome&#x27;s usage metrics.
If you haven&#x27;t used CSS Grid, now is a great time to learn it.
As more developers use grid, awareness of subgrid is also growing. Subgrid is already available in Firefox and will land in Chrome as part of the work by the Microsoft Team on GridNG.
Other features with strong growth in usage and awareness are

            >That shipping feeling</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">&quot;Real artists ship&quot; was one of Steve Jobs&#x27; mottos. You can clearly see that ethos still in present-day Apple. There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&amp;D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren&#x27;t deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn&#x27;t shipping. And shipping is what counts.
That&#x27;s a hard ethos to live by! It&#x27;s so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it&#x27;s an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.
We&#x27;ve been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we&#x27;d make a promise, which we occasionally couldn&#x27;t keep. It sucks.
But the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It&#x27;s addicting! Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.
Be a real artist. Ship.</p>

            >Ask HN: In API design; minimal responses or kitchen sink responses?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m currently refactoring my app away from websockets to a more traditional RESTful API (especially for things that should&#x27;ve been RESTful in the first place), and I wanted to know peoples&#x27; thoughts on whether response bodies should return just what you need (e.g. a need-to-know response), or return components that are common across different responses.
For example, given a hypothetical API, &#x60;GET /widgets/:id&#x60; would return a generic set of properties for the widget... the id, location, parts, etc.
Whereas &#x60;POST /widgets&#x60; could return all of that, but in a scenario where it doesn&#x27;t matter (that is, all the other values are null or defaults), then returning just &#x60;{ id }&#x60; would be sufficient.
Especially in the case of large response payloads, it may save some data from going over the wire, bu…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The most liberating aspect for me of writing emails rather than tweets is the natural limit on topics I might be tempted to have a take on. When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE&#x27;S A TAKE, THERE&#x27;S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it&#x27;s a sliver of that.
But it goes even deeper than that. When there&#x27;s no public outlet for all the possible takes, I&#x27;ve found that fewer takes actually develop. That it&#x27;s possible to see a story float by and go &quot;I don&#x27;t need or want to assume even a mental position on this&quot;. It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.
This is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…</p>

6 months ago I wrote about how 30-year-olds should basically go back to normal and no longer take many COVID precautions.
The holidays make this policy somewhat worse, because you can infect your family members. Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.
The key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them. Thus, you should probably take a few easy actions beforehand to bring this down to a small number of ho…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello Pick The Brain Community!!


As you may know, my new book, How To Break Up With Your Friends: Finding Meaning, Connection and Boundaries in Modern Friendship (Sounds True) is officially out January 18th! Part of me is excited to write this email to you, and the other part feels vulnerable and exposed as I officially introduce the book to the world.


I sold this latest title Feb 23, 2020. I thought this topic was important then. Three weeks later we went into quarantine. I couldn’t imagine the impact it would have across the board, but specifically in how we viewed our friendships. Nearly two years later, as we slowly start to emerge back out into the wilds of social engagement, there are even more questions. 


How do I really want to spend my time and with whom?

            >Why We Can All Benefit From Training Our Mental Wellbeing</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When we think of training, what comes to mind? Maybe it’s muscular people lifting weights intensely in a gym. Perhaps it’s people running long distances with huge packs on their backs. Perhaps we think about it from a workplace perspective, of pushing ourselves to be better, more educated in our professional lives.


The first thing that comes to mind however, probably isn’t training our mind. Our brain is one of the most important parts of our body so why don’t we make the effort to train it? Like our muscles, our brain becomes more resilient and pliable the more we work on it.


Think about when you get physically injured after not warming up. A warm up would’ve taken 10-15 minutes of your life and would’ve prevented you from hurting yourself. Without a warm up, the injury occurs and you…</p>

# What is the accessibility tree?
Assistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.

let sandwiches &#x3D; [&#x27;tuna&#x27;, &#x27;turkey&#x27;, &#x27;pb&amp;j&#x27;]; // logs [&quot;tuna&quot;, &quot;turkey&quot;, &quot;pb&amp;j&quot;] console.log(sandwiches); // logs tuna turkey pb&amp;j console.log(...sandwiches);  The spread operator can only be used inside of functions, arrays and objects. You cannot use it on its own.
This, for example, would throw an error.

Is Bootstrap still king here? Any other one that offers more extensive &quot;component&quot; libraries?

            >Ask HN: Why do developers like boring design?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For example, HN has a boring design that could benefit from improvements (e.g., make it easier to up/down-vote, navigate threads easier, etc.) and yet, many people like it this way.
Another example: Most devs that I know prefer CLI over GUI, even when GUI makes their life easier.
I&#x27;m not saying pragmatic design doesn&#x27;t have its place, but too much minimalism and simplicity is also not good IMO. In the HN example, some simple JS elements or better CSS wouldn&#x27;t hurt.

Is Bootstrap still king here? Any other one that offers more extensive &quot;component&quot; libraries?

Since our last update, we’ve continued to see improvements
in all browsers. All browsers started with much lower test scores at the beginning of the year, but
now all browsers have surpassed 90%! This means the web platform has significantly improved
interoperability of the five focus areas.

I don&#x27;t just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter.

If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar.

This is how mosts economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.

But it seems after iOS 6, almost everybody jumped on the bandwagon of flat design. Google introduced Material and Microsoft offered Metro and later Acrylic (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/).
But now we see some trends like in iOS that show that designers are embracing some of the intuitive aspects of skeuomorphism. For example, iOS icons have some depth now and look more 3D.
Why is this happening?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Took a while to warm to the characters, but worth it in the end.The story follows an exceptionally grumpy old lady, very much a stereotypical old person who doesn&#x27;t trust anyone and exists almost just for themselves.We also meet her grandson who is equally useless in his own ways. These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I&#x27;m glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.</p>

The conspiracies supposedly involve dozens of people working across many time zones in complete secrecy. That’s truly unlikely. Unlikely because cooperation of this sort is hard to find, especially among the powerful, and because […]</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 7, 2021 12:40 AM GMT

Last year I discovered, much to my chagrin, that always-on internet socializing was costly for me. This was inconvenient both because I’d spent rather a lot of time singing the praises of social media and instant messaging, and because we were in the middle of a global pandemic that had made online socializing an almost physical necessity. I made the decision at the time to put off changing my social media diet, and that was correct. But now there is in-person socializing again, and I’m changing how I use social media and messaging. I wanted to talk about this process and how great it was for me, but kept being nagged by the thought that the internet was full of essays about how the internet is bad, all of which I ignored or actively fought with,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last month I wrote about writing on web.dev. At that time, the first five parts of a fifteen-part course on responsive design had been published. I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:
Typography
Responsive images
The picture element
Icons
Theming
It wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.
The final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi folks, I&#x27;m building a social media app on Dart. I&#x27;ve been working on it for some time but it always bugs me whether I&#x27;m making a right choice by picking it over React.
Right now my plan is to build an MVP, apply to YC and then maybe keep Dart long term. Also, Our team is more familiar with Dart than React. We need a language which can work cross platform and is simpler to implement features.
Thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Watching science fiction shows/movies/games/comics/etc, the user interfaces are rather magnificent. But they rarely use elements from what people actually use.  And in actual user interfaces, there isn&#x27;t much that get&#x27;s used in SciFi.  Why is there such a large gap in these designs?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a given that Facebook, Twitter, et al, are designed to monopolize people&#x27;s attention and energy. This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.
I&#x27;ve seen several submissions by HNers working on &#x27;friendlier&#x27; social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.
This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I&#x27;ve tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.

Chen Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer living in Singapore, with an inordinate love for CSS, as evidenced by her blog (which is mostly about CSS) and her tweets (which are largely about typography and the web). She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions, and hopes to be able to climb outdoors one day. I talked to her about CSS, and in particular non-English writing systems.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company whose products offer digital end-to-end solutions for real estate.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I can completely see why Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast has become so popular. I&#x27;ve listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn&#x27;t have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan&#x27;s, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?
Such basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days. On many of the most controversial issues, even partaking in a conversation with &quot;the other side&quot; is often derided as &quot;…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.
Round displays, for example, make it fun to play with circular clip areas. Mobile screen notches and virtual keyboards offer challenges to best organize content that stays clear of them. And dual screen or foldable devices make us rethink how to best use available space in a number of different device postures.
Sketches of a round display, a common rectangular mobile display, and a device with a foldable display.



These recent evolutions of the web platform made it both more challenging and more interesting to design products. They’re great opportunities for us to break out of o…</p>

What resources can you recommend that teaches you about which layouts work best for different types of websites, different navigation styles (better to have it on the top/side/tucked because of Y), how to match colors and typography, etc?

What resources can you recommend that teaches you about which layouts work best for different types of websites, different navigation styles (better to have it on the top/side/tucked because of Y), how to match colors and typography, etc?

Overview #
Toasts are non-interactive, passive, and asynchronous short messages for users.
Generally they are used as an interface feedback pattern for informing the user
about the results of an action.

Android 


Interactions #
Toasts are unlike notifications,
alerts and
prompts because
they&#x27;re not interactive; they&#x27;re not meant to be dismissed or persist.
Notifications are for more important information, synchronous messaging that
requires interaction, or system level messages (as opposed to page level).
Toasts are more passive than other notice strategies.

Hans Moravec:  Behold my book Mind Children.  Within, I project that, in 2010 or thereabouts, we shall achieve strong AI.  I am not calling it &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot; because this term will not be coined for another 15 years or so.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">After Google’s Core Web Vitals announcement, performance became an important metric to our client’s—one that they knew they had to stay ahead of the curve on. As an agency, Versantus helps businesses solve technical problems with intelligent digital solutions, so we’ve always built websites that perform well. However, the Core Web Vitals updates have meant every detail, millisecond and image are now under the microscope.
Some of our clients, who were working with marketing agencies, received site recommendations to implement for improved performance metrics. For many others, performance simply moved up the agenda because of Core Web Vitals’ impact on search engine rankings. To give our client’s the best chance of high performance scoring, we knew we had to take a process-driven approach.

 I don’t understand the “things were better in the late 2000s” school of web development thinking going around lately. Maybe it’s nostalgia for when people first started? Or not wanting to learn new things?
Either way, no! I assure you, things are SOOO much better now. 😄

            >RBAC: Design for users belonging to multiple roles</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. 
We have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.
A user can have different roles in each sub org.
E.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.
Now user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.
Now when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.
In standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.
Also we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.
Is there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?

            >The UI fund</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome has launched a fund to support the UI ecosystem. We designed this fund to provide grants to people who work on design tools, CSS, and HTML.
All of us who work on the web regularly benefit from the work of people who create specifications, tools, demos, tutorials, and polyfills. Many of these resources are side projects, made available and supported free of charge. They exist because someone saw a need, created something to meet it, then shared it with the rest of the ecosystem.
We want to recognize and help support this work and invest in the CSS ecosystem. We&#x27;re excited to enable people to spend time on these projects and create more value for the web.

Now, to continue, you might want to consider these five ideas that can potentially boost your productivity as a freelancer.


Go Easy on the Multitasking


We’ll state for the record that we think multitasking is a great skill that every person should cultivate. It can come in handy when you’re in a tight pinch and need to think on the fly. 


Most of the time, however, doing more than what you should be doing is actually contrary to your goal of productivity. If you want to accomplish as many tasks as humanly possible in a day, the ability to focus is th…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The three-part almost nine-hour long documentary Get Back is quite fascinating.
First of all, the fact that all this footage exists is remarkable. It’s as if Disney had announced that they’d found the footage for a film shot between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.
Still, does this treasure trove really warrant the daunting length of this new Beatles documentary? As Terence puts it:
There are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering? The second problem is that it is far too short! Beatles obsessives (like me) could happily drink in a hundred hours of this stuff.
In some ways, watching Get Back is liking watching one of those Andy Warhol art projects where he just po…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 26, 2021 3:17 PM GMT

The goal of this essay is to help you understand EfficientZero, a reinforcement learning agent that obtains better-than-human median performance on a set of 26 Atari games after just two hours of real-time experience playing each game.
Specifically, it gets 116% of human median performance on the data-limited Atari 100k benchmark. The previously-best algorithm only reached about 41% of median human performance, so this is a reasonably large leap.
Chart stolen from paper

The benchmark is called 100k because agents only interact with the environment for 100,000 steps -- about two hours.  Note also that the human benchmarks were also set after the humans in question had about two hours of experience on the game.  So EfficientZero seems to -- at lea…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello.
This year I dived into UI/UX area and at the same time I work as a web developer. I sincerely love making good UI. But at my full time job it&#x27;s not always possible due to different reasons &#x3D;\
So I&#x27;ve been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).
I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.
This time it&#x27;s a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.
I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.
This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.

Rachel: What was your route into web development?
Bramus: As a kid, I always liked to tinker with things. I would spend days playing with my LEGO® bricks, building my own fantasy world and objects from scratch.
When we got a computer at home—an unusual device to own in the 1990s—I soon traded in the physical toys with computer games. I wasn&#x27;t an avid gamer though; I don&#x27;t think I ever finished a game entirely. Instead of finishing the games, I found myself modding them.
In 1997, while looking up information about those games and tools, I also discove…</p>

I&#x27;m looking to level up enough to be able to use design tools well + have an intuition for good vs bad design + be able to (hopefully) design well myself. Please assume I&#x27;m a complete noob. thanks in advance HN!

            >Don’t Forget the “lang” Attribute</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">An interesting notification from @cyishere popped up in my Twitter feed the other day:
I use a Chrome extension Read Aloud to read the web pages for improving my English. The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁
— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021
 
I replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!
The experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.
Speaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I work as a project manager in civil engineering. During my spare time I program and try to learn a thing or two.
I started to read about design patterns and I wonder if anyone is using those principles when they build an organization/company.
If so, which patterns and why?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I teach a college-level intro to html/css/js to mostly business majors. We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare&#x27;s public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.
Is there a way to satisfy these reqs?
1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)
2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)
3. Is an IDE or IDE extension
4. Keeps some sort of version history
5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. At this point I want to say thank you to every single reader, to everyone who supports me, sends me feedback or suggestions. I love this project so much because my readership (you!) is so amazing.
When I looked up something these days in my archive, I realised how true the introduction from last year is still today.
On the topic of creating for the web: I personally think micro-typography, good translations and good content writing matters a lot to the success of a product. So I wrote an article on well crafted translations and why automation isn’t good enough yet, showing some prominent examples that just aren’t good enough.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a disorientating time in America. So many societal seams are unraveling simultaneously. So few ideas for how to stitch those seams back together find common cause. No wonder despair and anger comes so easy to so many right now.
These dark emotions are then propelled by the particle accelerator that is Twitter into super-charged takes. All that energy has definitively nuked any previous utopian hope that &quot;connecting the world&quot; would lead to peace, love, and understanding.
That, ironically, is perhaps the one thing everyone does seem to agree on at the moment: social media is making everything political worse. But of course such a conclusion is only shared until the question of who to blame emerges or what to do about it is brought up, and then it&#x27;s back to the tribal drums.

TLDR

There’s an organization based in London called the Rationalist Association. It was founded in 1885. Historically, it focused on publishing books and articles related to atheism and science, including works by Darwin, Bertrand Russell, J. B. S. Haldane, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Karl Popper.
The topics covered overlap with the present-day rationalist movement (centered on Lesswrong). They include religion and atheism, philosophy (especially philosophy of science and ethics), evolution, and psychology.
According to Wikipedia, membership of the Rationalist Association peaked in 1959 with more than 5000 members and with Bertrand Russell as President.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI &amp; Games YouTube channel breaks it down.
One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.

function wizard (args) { // Get the argument values 	let {name, job, spell, isEvil} &#x3D; Object.assign({ job: &#x27;Wizard&#x27;, spell: null, isEvil: false }, args); console.log(name, job, spell, isEvil); }  A few astute readers wrote to me letting me know that you can achieve the same result by destructuring directly in the parameter assignment.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Historically, RS has nodes and slices. One node made of a given number of slices (varies by node type). Data is distributed over slices, and only the slice holding a block can access that block.
These days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.
So I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 ins…</p>

Those of us who have worked on open source can spot it, burnout is afoot. The project got bigger than what the person or organization could realistically maintain. The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the past, I’ve written about how Proxies can be used to make data reactive in state-based UI. They’re what my own state-based UI library, Reef, currently uses under-the-hood.
But a student of mine recently put together a reduced test case showing how they can severally hurt performance in apps that have high levels of interactivity.

            >Ask HN: In API design; minimal responses or kitchen sink responses?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m currently refactoring my app away from websockets to a more traditional RESTful API (especially for things that should&#x27;ve been RESTful in the first place), and I wanted to know peoples&#x27; thoughts on whether response bodies should return just what you need (e.g. a need-to-know response), or return components that are common across different responses.
For example, given a hypothetical API, &#x60;GET /widgets/:id&#x60; would return a generic set of properties for the widget... the id, location, parts, etc.
Whereas &#x60;POST /widgets&#x60; could return all of that, but in a scenario where it doesn&#x27;t matter (that is, all the other values are null or defaults), then returning just &#x60;{ id }&#x60; would be sufficient.
Especially in the case of large response payloads, it may save some data from going over the wire, bu…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The most liberating aspect for me of writing emails rather than tweets is the natural limit on topics I might be tempted to have a take on. When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE&#x27;S A TAKE, THERE&#x27;S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it&#x27;s a sliver of that.
But it goes even deeper than that. When there&#x27;s no public outlet for all the possible takes, I&#x27;ve found that fewer takes actually develop. That it&#x27;s possible to see a story float by and go &quot;I don&#x27;t need or want to assume even a mental position on this&quot;. It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.
This is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…</p>

6 months ago I wrote about how 30-year-olds should basically go back to normal and no longer take many COVID precautions.
The holidays make this policy somewhat worse, because you can infect your family members. Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.
The key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them. Thus, you should probably take a few easy actions beforehand to bring this down to a small number of ho…</p>

What is the Launch Handler API? #
There are many ways to launch a Progressive Web App. Probably the most common is via the icon on the
home screen or the app drawer of the device. But when you think about it, there are many other ways
a launch can happen:
A share action when the app is a
share target.
A user click in the file explorer opening the PWA, which
acts as a file handler.
A registered protocol handler that the PWA may launch as the
result of a matching protocol.
A click on a
push notification or an app icon shortcut.
There are even more ways, but you get the idea. Given the manifold possibilities for launching PWAs,

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello Pick The Brain Community!!


As you may know, my new book, How To Break Up With Your Friends: Finding Meaning, Connection and Boundaries in Modern Friendship (Sounds True) is officially out January 18th! Part of me is excited to write this email to you, and the other part feels vulnerable and exposed as I officially introduce the book to the world.


I sold this latest title Feb 23, 2020. I thought this topic was important then. Three weeks later we went into quarantine. I couldn’t imagine the impact it would have across the board, but specifically in how we viewed our friendships. Nearly two years later, as we slowly start to emerge back out into the wilds of social engagement, there are even more questions. 


How do I really want to spend my time and with whom?

            >Why We Can All Benefit From Training Our Mental Wellbeing</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When we think of training, what comes to mind? Maybe it’s muscular people lifting weights intensely in a gym. Perhaps it’s people running long distances with huge packs on their backs. Perhaps we think about it from a workplace perspective, of pushing ourselves to be better, more educated in our professional lives.


The first thing that comes to mind however, probably isn’t training our mind. Our brain is one of the most important parts of our body so why don’t we make the effort to train it? Like our muscles, our brain becomes more resilient and pliable the more we work on it.


Think about when you get physically injured after not warming up. A warm up would’ve taken 10-15 minutes of your life and would’ve prevented you from hurting yourself. Without a warm up, the injury occurs and you…</p>

# What is the accessibility tree?
Assistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The spread syntax operator (...) takes an array or object (or other iterable) and expands its items into their own individual values.
let sandwiches &#x3D; [&#x27;tuna&#x27;, &#x27;turkey&#x27;, &#x27;pb&amp;j&#x27;]; // logs [&quot;tuna&quot;, &quot;turkey&quot;, &quot;pb&amp;j&quot;] console.log(sandwiches); // logs tuna turkey pb&amp;j console.log(...sandwiches);  The spread operator can only be used inside of functions, arrays and objects. You cannot use it on its own.
This, for example, would throw an error.
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;.</p>

            >Ask HN: Why do developers like boring design?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For example, HN has a boring design that could benefit from improvements (e.g., make it easier to up/down-vote, navigate threads easier, etc.) and yet, many people like it this way.
Another example: Most devs that I know prefer CLI over GUI, even when GUI makes their life easier.
I&#x27;m not saying pragmatic design doesn&#x27;t have its place, but too much minimalism and simplicity is also not good IMO. In the HN example, some simple JS elements or better CSS wouldn&#x27;t hurt.

browser compatibility problems in five key focus areas.
This effort is also known as Interop 2021, matching the name of
Interop 2022, which is the continuation of
this effort.
&gt;90%
score in all browsers
Since our last update, we’ve continued to see improvements
in all browsers. All browsers started with much lower test scores at the beginning of the year, but
now all browsers have surpassed 90%! This means the web platform has significantly improved
interoperability of the five focus areas.

The echoes of history provide a strange comfort: We are not the first people to be struggling with this.
I don&#x27;t just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.
William Buckley&#x27;s show The Firing Line is a treasure trove in this regard.

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter.

If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar.

This is how mosts economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few years ago, skeuomorphism was wildly popular. From Windows XP, Vista, 7 to iOS (before v6) and android. But it seems after iOS 6, almost everybody jumped on the bandwagon of flat design. Google introduced Material and Microsoft offered Metro and later Acrylic (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/).
But now we see some trends like in iOS that show that designers are embracing some of the intuitive aspects of skeuomorphism. For example, iOS icons have some depth now and look more 3D.
Why is this happening?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 7, 2021 12:40 AM GMT

Last year I discovered, much to my chagrin, that always-on internet socializing was costly for me. This was inconvenient both because I’d spent rather a lot of time singing the praises of social media and instant messaging, and because we were in the middle of a global pandemic that had made online socializing an almost physical necessity. I made the decision at the time to put off changing my social media diet, and that was correct. But now there is in-person socializing again, and I’m changing how I use social media and messaging. I wanted to talk about this process and how great it was for me, but kept being nagged by the thought that the internet was full of essays about how the internet is bad, all of which I ignored or actively fought with,…</p>

Typography
Responsive images
The picture element
Icons
Theming
It wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.
The final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.</p>

            >Dart/React for a full fledged social media app in the short term and long term?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi folks, I&#x27;m building a social media app on Dart. I&#x27;ve been working on it for some time but it always bugs me whether I&#x27;m making a right choice by picking it over React.
Right now my plan is to build an MVP, apply to YC and then maybe keep Dart long term. Also, Our team is more familiar with Dart than React. We need a language which can work cross platform and is simpler to implement features.
Thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Watching science fiction shows/movies/games/comics/etc, the user interfaces are rather magnificent. But they rarely use elements from what people actually use.  And in actual user interfaces, there isn&#x27;t much that get&#x27;s used in SciFi.  Why is there such a large gap in these designs?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a given that Facebook, Twitter, et al, are designed to monopolize people&#x27;s attention and energy. This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.
I&#x27;ve seen several submissions by HNers working on &#x27;friendlier&#x27; social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.
This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I&#x27;ve tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This post is part of Designcember. A celebration of web design, brought to you by web.dev.
Chen Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer living in Singapore, with an inordinate love for CSS, as evidenced by her blog (which is mostly about CSS) and her tweets (which are largely about typography and the web). She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions, and hopes to be able to climb outdoors one day. I talked to her about CSS, and in particular non-English writing systems.
Rachel: What was your route into web design and development?

            >How QuintoAndar increased conversion rates and pages per session by improving page performance</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">QuintoAndar is a Brazilian proptech company whose products offer digital end-to-end solutions for real estate. This year, we carried out a project focused on improving the performance of a content hub in our app, and had encouraging results in increasing user traffic and conversion metrics.
46%
reduction in bounce rate
87%
increase in pages per session
5%
improvement in conversion during validation phase
Challenges #
Our app has a condominium content hub with over 40,000 pages, where users can get information about their properties, check photos of the common areas, read about the neighborhood, and find available listings for rent or sale. These pages are very important for QuintoAndar:
They are an important source of organic traffic, with a steadily increasing number of users coming from …</p>

            >Everything popular is problematic</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I can completely see why Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast has become so popular. I&#x27;ve listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn&#x27;t have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan&#x27;s, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?
Such basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days. On many of the most controversial issues, even partaking in a conversation with &quot;the other side&quot; is often derided as &quot;…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.
Round displays, for example, make it fun to play with circular clip areas. Mobile screen notches and virtual keyboards offer challenges to best organize content that stays clear of them. And dual screen or foldable devices make us rethink how to best use available space in a number of different device postures.
Sketches of a round display, a common rectangular mobile display, and a device with a foldable display.



These recent evolutions of the web platform made it both more challenging and more interesting to design products. They’re great opportunities for us to break out of o…</p>

Overview #
Toasts are non-interactive, passive, and asynchronous short messages for users.
Generally they are used as an interface feedback pattern for informing the user
about the results of an action.

Android 


Interactions #
Toasts are unlike notifications,
alerts and
prompts because
they&#x27;re not interactive; they&#x27;re not meant to be dismissed or persist.
Notifications are for more important information, synchronous messaging that
requires interaction, or system level messages (as opposed to page level).
Toasts are more passive than other notice strategies.

Hans Moravec:  Behold my book Mind Children.  Within, I project that, in 2010 or thereabouts, we shall achieve strong AI.  I am not calling it &quot;Artificial General Intelligence&quot; because this term will not be coined for another 15 years or so.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">After Google’s Core Web Vitals announcement, performance became an important metric to our client’s—one that they knew they had to stay ahead of the curve on. As an agency, Versantus helps businesses solve technical problems with intelligent digital solutions, so we’ve always built websites that perform well. However, the Core Web Vitals updates have meant every detail, millisecond and image are now under the microscope.
Some of our clients, who were working with marketing agencies, received site recommendations to implement for improved performance metrics. For many others, performance simply moved up the agenda because of Core Web Vitals’ impact on search engine rankings. To give our client’s the best chance of high performance scoring, we knew we had to take a process-driven approach.

A handful of developers who are just learning they have ADHD have asked me what tools and systems and approaches work for me, so today I wanted to talk about that a bit.
Let’s dig in!
tl;dr: I’ve learned to embrace my ADHD, and work with it instead of against it.

 I don’t understand the “things were better in the late 2000s” school of web development thinking going around lately. Maybe it’s nostalgia for when people first started? Or not wanting to learn new things?
Either way, no! I assure you, things are SOOO much better now. 😄
 I wanted to unpack this tweet a bit, because I have strong feelings about it.</p>

            >RBAC: Design for users belonging to multiple roles</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. 
We have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.
A user can have different roles in each sub org.
E.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.
Now user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.
Now when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.
In standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.
Also we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.
Is there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?

            >The UI fund</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Chrome has launched a fund to support the UI ecosystem. We designed this fund to provide grants to people who work on design tools, CSS, and HTML.
All of us who work on the web regularly benefit from the work of people who create specifications, tools, demos, tutorials, and polyfills. Many of these resources are side projects, made available and supported free of charge. They exist because someone saw a need, created something to meet it, then shared it with the rest of the ecosystem.
We want to recognize and help support this work and invest in the CSS ecosystem. We&#x27;re excited to enable people to spend time on these projects and create more value for the web.

Now, to continue, you might want to consider these five ideas that can potentially boost your productivity as a freelancer.


Go Easy on the Multitasking


We’ll state for the record that we think multitasking is a great skill that every person should cultivate. It can come in handy when you’re in a tight pinch and need to think on the fly. 


Most of the time, however, doing more than what you should be doing is actually contrary to your goal of productivity. If you want to accomplish as many tasks as humanly possible in a day, the ability to focus is th…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The three-part almost nine-hour long documentary Get Back is quite fascinating.
First of all, the fact that all this footage exists is remarkable. It’s as if Disney had announced that they’d found the footage for a film shot between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.
Still, does this treasure trove really warrant the daunting length of this new Beatles documentary? As Terence puts it:
There are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering? The second problem is that it is far too short! Beatles obsessives (like me) could happily drink in a hundred hours of this stuff.
In some ways, watching Get Back is liking watching one of those Andy Warhol art projects where he just po…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 26, 2021 3:17 PM GMT

The goal of this essay is to help you understand EfficientZero, a reinforcement learning agent that obtains better-than-human median performance on a set of 26 Atari games after just two hours of real-time experience playing each game.
Specifically, it gets 116% of human median performance on the data-limited Atari 100k benchmark. The previously-best algorithm only reached about 41% of median human performance, so this is a reasonably large leap.
Chart stolen from paper

The benchmark is called 100k because agents only interact with the environment for 100,000 steps -- about two hours.  Note also that the human benchmarks were also set after the humans in question had about two hours of experience on the game.  So EfficientZero seems to -- at lea…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello.
This year I dived into UI/UX area and at the same time I work as a web developer. I sincerely love making good UI. But at my full time job it&#x27;s not always possible due to different reasons &#x3D;\
So I&#x27;ve been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).
I decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.
This time it&#x27;s a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.
I tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.
This is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.

Rachel: What was your route into web development?
Bramus: As a kid, I always liked to tinker with things. I would spend days playing with my LEGO® bricks, building my own fantasy world and objects from scratch.
When we got a computer at home—an unusual device to own in the 1990s—I soon traded in the physical toys with computer games. I wasn&#x27;t an avid gamer though; I don&#x27;t think I ever finished a game entirely. Instead of finishing the games, I found myself modding them.
In 1997, while looking up information about those games and tools, I also discove…</p>

I&#x27;m looking to level up enough to be able to use design tools well + have an intuition for good vs bad design + be able to (hopefully) design well myself. Please assume I&#x27;m a complete noob. thanks in advance HN!

            >Don’t Forget the “lang” Attribute</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">An interesting notification from @cyishere popped up in my Twitter feed the other day:
I use a Chrome extension Read Aloud to read the web pages for improving my English. The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁
— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021
 
I replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!
The experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.
Speaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I work as a project manager in civil engineering. During my spare time I program and try to learn a thing or two.
I started to read about design patterns and I wonder if anyone is using those principles when they build an organization/company.
If so, which patterns and why?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I teach a college-level intro to html/css/js to mostly business majors. We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare&#x27;s public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.
Is there a way to satisfy these reqs?
1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)
2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)
3. Is an IDE or IDE extension
4. Keeps some sort of version history
5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)

every year towards the end of it I want to remind you that if you like my work, you can help financing this newsletter by giving a contribution. At this point I want to say thank you to every single reader, to everyone who supports me, sends me feedback or suggestions. I love this project so much because my readership (you!) is so amazing.
When I looked up something these days in my archive, I realised how true the introduction from last year is still today.
On the topic of creating for the web: I personally think micro-typography, good translations and good content writing matters a lot to the success of a product. So I wrote an article on well crafted translations and why automation isn’t good enough yet, showing some prominent examples that just aren’t good enough.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On the Monday before Thanksgiving, I had surgery on my nose for my skin cancer. I’m glad to report that surgery went fine and I’m cancer free (for now). The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a disorientating time in America. So many societal seams are unraveling simultaneously. So few ideas for how to stitch those seams back together find common cause. No wonder despair and anger comes so easy to so many right now.
These dark emotions are then propelled by the particle accelerator that is Twitter into super-charged takes. All that energy has definitively nuked any previous utopian hope that &quot;connecting the world&quot; would lead to peace, love, and understanding.
That, ironically, is perhaps the one thing everyone does seem to agree on at the moment: social media is making everything political worse. But of course such a conclusion is only shared until the question of who to blame emerges or what to do about it is brought up, and then it&#x27;s back to the tribal drums.

TLDR

There’s an organization based in London called the Rationalist Association. It was founded in 1885. Historically, it focused on publishing books and articles related to atheism and science, including works by Darwin, Bertrand Russell, J. B. S. Haldane, George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, and Karl Popper.
The topics covered overlap with the present-day rationalist movement (centered on Lesswrong). They include religion and atheism, philosophy (especially philosophy of science and ethics), evolution, and psychology.
According to Wikipedia, membership of the Rationalist Association peaked in 1959 with more than 5000 members and with Bertrand Russell as President.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI &amp; Games YouTube channel breaks it down.
One interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting. Louis Vuitton, but Loot Boxes.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last week, I shared my preferred way to pass large set of arguments into a function using object destructuring and the Object.assign() method.
function wizard (args) { // Get the argument values 	let {name, job, spell, isEvil} &#x3D; Object.assign({ job: &#x27;Wizard&#x27;, spell: null, isEvil: false }, args); console.log(name, job, spell, isEvil); }  A few astute readers wrote to me letting me know that you can achieve the same result by destructuring directly in the parameter assignment.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Historically, RS has nodes and slices. One node made of a given number of slices (varies by node type). Data is distributed over slices, and only the slice holding a block can access that block.
These days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.
So I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 ins…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I don&#x27;t know what it is about cooking and recipe-focused websites. They seem to be some of the worst in terms of pop ups, and superfluous garbage content. I spend so much time searching for the actual content on most pages because there are so many links to other crap.
For example, check out this Betty Crocker page where there&#x27;s about 300px of whitespace at the top, a huge useless picture of flour, and a navbar that doesn&#x27;t quite stick to the top of the page (viewing on Firefox) https://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/tipslibrary/charts-timetables-measuring/equivalent-measures-abbreviations
Another example is allrecipes.com. I think it fares pretty well on Desktop, but on my phone I notice they insert adds throughout the ingredient list and instructions. Also met with a full-screen popup from Amazon about Cyber Monday.
There&#x27;s gotta be some plain and simple sites out there, and I&#x27;d like to hear about them.

I could not find a way to report it, and given the millions they have invested in the rebranding, I am assuming they will consider it as one with high priority.

            >Quick tips on how to use the Algorithm Design Manual</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Ok so the high level breakdown:
1. Read and do the problems for the first half of the book. Do not rush this part of the process.
2. Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples
3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;22hwcnXIGgk&amp;list&#x3D;PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx
4. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics
5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview
6. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn&#x27;t too valuable. 
7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out
Ultimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a secret to everyone! This post is for RSS subscribers only.
Read more about RSS Club.

Twitter has been fever-pitched about Web3, blockchain, and NFTs. It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.
I spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.
NFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.
Two weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello HN:
I have been developing apps for iOS and Android for about 10 years. Started with Objective C and Java and then moved to Swift and Kotlin. I don&#x27;t have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.
Have you switched from native to cross platform dev?
Have you tried both flutter and react native?
Which one did you prefer and why?
Thanks!
Edit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:
1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).
2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 19, 2021 12:00 AM GMT

I’m an independent researcher working on AI alignment and the theory of agency. I’m 29 years old, will make about $90k this year, and set my own research agenda. I deal with basically zero academic bullshit - my grant applications each take about one day’s attention to write (and decisions typically come back in ~1 month), and I publish the bulk of my work right here on LessWrong/AF. Best of all, I work on some really cool technical problems which I expect are central to the future of humanity.

            >Programmers should stop celebrating incompetence</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the valiant effort to combat imposter syndrome and gatekeeping, the programming world has taken a bad turn down a blind alley by celebrating incompetence. You don&#x27;t have to reduce an entire profession to a clueless gang of copy-pasta pirates to make new recruits feel welcome. It undermines the aspiration to improve. It reduces the work to magical thinking. It is not good.
I say this an evaluation of the prescription, not of the diagnosis. The programming world absolutely has had, and still has, challenges with imposter syndrome and gatekeeping. In large part because, unlike so many other professional fields, a high percentage of the people working in programming are self-taught. (Including yours truly!).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m a fan of logical properties in CSS. As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.
Alaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!
More than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.
It’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…</p>

Let’s dig in!
An object of arguments If I have just two or three parameters, I’ll accept them as individual arguments just like you would expect.

            >Ask HN: What should the future of web/UI testing frameworks be like?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers / Cypress / Puppeteer / Playwright / others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what &quot;frameworks of the future&quot; should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being &quot;good enough&quot; for the most part?
My top &quot;problems&quot;, in some shape or form, from existing products:
- Be faster to complete builds
- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)
- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)
- Don&#x27;t be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical &#x27;test&#x27; across Playwright and Cypress)
- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)
- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification
What do the HN folks think?

This is an essay describing a basic sanity-inducing mental movement that I use approximately ten times per week, and suspect other people would benefit from adopting (and regularly reminding each other to do). I&#x27;ve talked about it elsewhere, but until now it didn&#x27;t have its own linkable reference post.

P1: Things are often not what they seem.
This can be because the seeming itself is broken, e.g. the progression that goes:
 &quot;Well, here I am in 1700&#x27;s America and it sure seems to me that these black folk are fundamentally intellectually and morally and spiritually inferior to white folk&quot; or &quot;Well, here I am in 1800&#x27;s America and it sure seems to me that these women are constitutionally incapable of holding political office&quot; or &quot;Well, here I am in…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
At the beginning of 2020, the Chrome team across mobile and desktop
laid out a plan to improve the discoverability and engagement of
installed web apps. Our work led to a greater than 100% increase in
PWA installation and engagement. We achieved this by researching
existing features, running A/B test experiments and user interviews
to gain insight into users perceptions and expectations. This article
covers how we got there.
# Unified install language
The call-to-action that triggers a PWA install was inconsistent across
the web platform. For Chrome on Android, we had settled on Add to
home screen, but on our Desktop Platforms, we
emphasized Install. The rationale for this discrepancy came from
a study the team ran in 2016 that compared different strings. The
team found that…</p>

For example, let’s say you have a JS library that you want to distribute in a browser-ready format (an IIFE or revealing module pattern), as well as a single file with ES module exports, and another for use with Node.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Not only my first step, but what&#x27;s the path which I should follow in order to become good at designing my own UI/UX for my products?
I am currently a full stack web developer, and I mostly use templates / pre-made components when working on projects, but I want to start doing my own custom designs.
I am sure that I need to learn the basics of UI/UX design first, then move to a tool such as Figma / XD / Sketch.
But the number of resources online is just too much, I can&#x27;t weed out the bad ones, and I can&#x27;t figure out a clear roadmap for myself on how to appraoch my journey?
Your input on the subject would be greatly appreciated.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It used to be fairly easy to find an entry point into that most-helpful UI in one of &quot;my repositories&quot;, or that of a third-party, by selecting a non-main branch at the top-level of a repo&#x27;s GitHub Web UI, then clicking the Contribute dropdown on the far-right of that element, and then clicking Compare.
From there, one could play with the base and compare dropdowns.
Of late, I find it&#x27;s completely hit-or-miss, regardless of the browser, and regardless of that browser&#x27;s regular vs. private mode (if it has that distinction).
Anyone else experienced similar? I&#x27;ve found it quite disruptive the past several days, but maybe it&#x27;s just me?

            >Ask HN: What are the fundamental diffs between modern web vs. desktop UI models</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Roughly once a week, HN will feature a link to a new web-based UI framework/toolkit. These seem to build upon a history that, briefly stated, seems to go: HTML -&gt; HTML5 -&gt; JS -&gt; Node -&gt; React -&gt; [ a lot of stuff ]. Obviously there are things that branched off at various points along the way.
As a purely native desktop application developer, whenever I read about these frameworks, they seem to contain almost no trace of any of the programming models/designs/lessons that were learned between (say) 1980 and 2005 in the domain of native GUI toolkits (both platform-specific and cross-platform). There&#x27;s almost no trace of any of the vocabulary, but also very little sign of any of the fundamental concepts (widgets, &quot;classic&quot; MVC, etc.)
So I&#x27;m asking without (much) predjudice: what&#x27;s so different about UI/UX in web-dev that justifies throwing away all these design lessons? Or are they really still in modern web frameworks and I&#x27;m just not seeing them?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">There was a time when liberal ideals of self-determination, self-regulation, and free-range independence naturally extended to parenting as well. Such ideals were seen in stark opposition to conservative parenting based on obedience, discipline, and reverence. Today it seems like these roles are often reversed.
The strictest parents I have encountered since we had kids a decade ago are those who&#x27;d be flattered to be called hippies. They&#x27;re not obsessed with honoring god or country, like the old authoritarians (though they have their own cultural religions), but they&#x27;re just as keen to shield their kids from the devils of the day. Be that screen time or sugar or other moral or bodily corruptions.
In fact, the appeal of purity somehow seems even stronger with this modern authoritarian crowd.…</p>

In this article, I will explore ways to keep motivation high and bounce back from setbacks; these methods are psychology-proven to work in any situation. Let&#x27;s dive deep into this topic.

One of the best ways to motivate yourself is by considering your &quot;why.&quot; What do we mean by that? Think about why you want to achieve a certain goal. &quot;But, what if I don&#x27;t know why?&quot; you might ask.


Well, there&#x27;s a way for you to find your motivation and discover your true &quot;why.&quot;

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been publishing on my blog since 2006 - something I&#x27;m personally proud of. My blog is the personal little space I&#x27;ve carved for myself on the web. Whilst I&#x27;m here in the real world, my blog will exist in the digital world, and every single post URL will work (404s are for the weak! 😏).
Back in 2015 I set myself an goal to publish at least two posts a month, for the most part I&#x27;ve managed. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of &quot;easy goals&quot; - something that&#x27;s achievable without it causing stress - so doing some writing twice a month definitely hit that sweet spot.
This particular blog has been active since 2006, but I had also toyed with more diary-like sites during the early-2000s but the URLs are so obscure not only has the web forgotten, but they&#x27;re wiped clean from my own memory.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on November 11, 2021 3:58 PM GMT

Container logistics is an interesting but complicated topic, with a lot of implicit knowledge kept by industry insiders. In this post, I&#x27;ll give a brief overview, based on my experiences having worked in the industry for three different shipping companies (all located in Chile) over a period of five years. Hopefully, this will allow people to get more accurate models of the heavy port congestion in Long Beach that has been theorized about extensively here on LW. I can&#x27;t comment on circumstances specific to that port or the US more generally; but there&#x27;s a set of underlying intuitions that should give people a solid, universal foundation to think about the issue. Based on those intuitions, I think people are way too optimistic about simple and eas…</p>

From raster to vector #
Have you ever scaled an image and the result was pixelated and unsatisfactory? If
so, you have probably dealt with a raster image format such as WebP, PNG, or JPG.
          
  
    Scaling up a raster image makes it look pixelated.
  

In contrast, vector graphics are images that are defined by points in a coordinate system. These
points are connected by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. Vector graphics have an
advantage over raster graphics in that they may be scaled up or down to any resolution
without pixelation.
          
  
    Scaling up a vector image with no loss of quality.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a &quot;That&#x27;s distracting&quot; comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it — or feel it — about something you&#x27;re designing.

What&#x27;s distracting about it? Maybe something&#x27;s too colorful. Maybe it&#x27;s something regarding the layout. Maybe it&#x27;s the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it&#x27;s a specific animation. Maybe it&#x27;s even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture.
So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you&#x27;re staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it&#x27;s common to narrow your focus until only the  offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says &quot;it&#x27;s this t…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the biggest environmental issues we are facing today is climate change. It has an impact on every aspect of our lives, including our health and wellbeing. Recycling means fewer raw materials are required to make items, which helps reduce our carbon footprint and our contribution to climate change. A new study by packaging experts RAJA UK has uncovered just how much waste is not being recycled, and as a result, ends up in our ecosystem. Here are just a few of the ways not recycling or reusing items is having a direct impact on both our health and the world around us.

In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.

It has methods for creating a Date() object from a string, formatting dates and times, and getting back specific values. But it lacks native methods to add or subtract time from a date.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The way to work without regrets is to pursue projects that&#x27;ll have been worth your time even if they don&#x27;t pan out. Projects that&#x27;ll tickle your curiosity, flex your competency, and teach you something new regardless of where they ultimately end up. Projects that leave you better off, as a person, despite not being a commercial or critical success. If you work on projects like this, it&#x27;s impossible to waste your time.
My personal nightmare is investing years of my life into something that ends up going nowhere, and then feeling like it was all for nothing. That&#x27;s how life slips through your fingers. That&#x27;s how you cross over from your 20s to your 30s and curse what you missed along the way because the bet didn&#x27;t pay out.
When you look for projects that&#x27;ll be worth it even if they don&#x27;t work, you know you&#x27;ll engage the fires of intrinsic motivation. Tap into the magic of flow. Look with satisfaction at a good day&#x27;s work, well before you&#x27;re done.
That&#x27;s a work of meaning.</p>

This post is the first in a series of transcribed Discord conversations between Richard Ngo and Eliezer Yudkowsky, moderated by Nate Soares. We&#x27;ve also added Richard and Nate&#x27;s running summaries of the conversation (and others&#x27; replies) from Google Docs.
Later conversation participants include Ajeya Cotra, Beth Barnes, Carl Shulman, Holden Karnofsky, Jaan Tallinn, Paul Christiano, Rob Bensinger, and Rohin Shah.
The transcripts are a complete record of several Discord channels MIRI made for discussion. We tried to edit the transcripts as little as possible, other than to fix typos and a handful of confusingly-worded sentences, to add some paragraph breaks, and to add referenced figures and links. We didn&#x27;t end up redacting any substantive content,…</p>

      Florence Studios is a one-woman studio working with independent businesses, to help them grow and grab attention.

Taking the jump into freelance is a big deal! When I first started my freelance journey, I found loads of blog posts from really successful artists and designers that were useful (to some extent). However, it would have been even more helpful to hear from someone who was just a few steps ahead of me in their journey, rather than leaps and bounds in front. For example, advice on approaching clients, honing a freelance workflow, developing as a designer would have been great resources to have.
That’s why I want to sh…</p>

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Chrome 100 has a three digit version number
Take a stroll down memory lane and celebrate
#100CoolWebMoments since Chrome&#x27;s first release.
There are some important changes to the user agent string.
The Multi-Screen Window Placement API
makes it possible to enumerate the displays connected to a user&#x27;s machine,
and place windows on specific screens.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 100.
# Chrome 100
When browsers first reached version 10, there were a few
issues as the major version number went from one digit to two. Hopefully,
we learned a few things that&#x27;ll ease the transition from two digits to three.
Chrome 100 is available now, and Firefox 100 ships very soon. These three
digit version number…</p>

          <p>Google Chrome launched in 2018, and in March 2022 we are celebrating the launch of Chrome version 100 with a scroll down memory lane. #100CoolWebMoments remembers some cool, fun, interesting, and important things that have happened in the past 14 years.
A lot has happened on the web since 2018. If you read Ethan Marcotte’s 2010 A List Apart article on responsive web design on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.
Chrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell and Frances Berriman introduced Progressive Web Apps in 2015, with Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser to replace Internet Explorer in the same year.
In March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with Cascade Layers landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.
Tell us which moments you loved the most. If we&#x27;ve missed anything (and we&#x27;re sure we have), tweet us @ChromiumDev with #100CoolWebMoments.</p>

Of course I have my own thoughts and I&#x27;m going to present them soon in some blog post, but I&#x27;d like to ask what you guys think too.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30817570 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why isn&#x27;t Microsoft good with design consistency?</a>
          <p>With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.
With Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you&#x27;re faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.
This doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I&#x27;d like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they&#x27;re not doing that.
I&#x27;m happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.

          <a href=https://rubrikinc.github.io/wachy/ target="_blank">Show HN: Wachy – A UI for eBPF-based performance debugging</a>
          <p>eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

          <p>Recently I started analyzing much more the documents and stylesheets I produce as well as reading more the official CSS and HTML specs. While catering to implementers of user agents, they are generally a goldmine of solid information.
I&#x27;d like also to get inspired by quality work on the web, but inspecting websites pretty much never yields anything that resembles a readable document, HTML semantics and CSS quality are generally in a disastrous state.
Thus my question, can you suggest websites who&#x27;s html and css can be considered of extremely high standards?
I can&#x27;t list many safe for MDN and wikipedia.

          <a href=https://buttmover.com target="_blank">Show HN: Butt Mover, an IRL Productivity and Health Improvement Game</a>
          <p>I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I&#x27;m immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.
Hence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;
1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.
2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.
Those who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.
I&#x27;ve been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.
I hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.

          <p>One of the best things about being an ad designer is working on a wide range of projects and client accounts. But the downside is that you’ll sometimes encounter time-stretched clients who, understandably, are slow to give feedback. Unfortunately, these delays can make it tricky for you to meet project timelines—and to get paid on time.
So how can you help clients give you approval faster? Let’s look at a few simple strategies you can use to keep the work a-flowing.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been looking to increase my use of the keyboard, primarily for the productivity gains that I find myself able to reach by consistently sticking to the keyboard. Since I started though, I&#x27;ve noticed fairly uneven support across applications. For example, reviewing my day&#x27;s worth of meetings and responding to each invitation using Google calendar is very painful to do on the keyboard.
What are people&#x27;s favorite recommendations of keyboard-based productivity tools?

          <p>Just wondering what could be the issue here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min()
Actually, I get the same error when trying to access max() also. I tried it in 4 different browser variations and all return the same error: &quot;developer.mozilla.org redirected you too many times.&quot;

          <p>I&#x27;m browsing with JS and cookies disabled for speed and safety. Lately, more and more simple and plain blogs require JS to show any text on website. Can we just agree on letting basic html do it&#x27;s thing? Why insist on JS to be able to show simple text on webpage?
For example:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30725933
Go ahead, disable JS and try opening blog on this link. Won&#x27;t happen...
This page is simple dark text on white background with some images sprinkled in. Why is JS required to show this?
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in this...

          <p>You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:
There is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.
It certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.
I hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.

personal intro
When I sent out the last edition, we were in a pandemic. Now, there’s also a new war between multiple political forces, creating fear and uncertainty around the people of the world. As if the pandemic situation wouldn’t be stressful enough, this adds up to anxiety, feelings of helplessness and »what the hell is happening in the world?« thoughts.

      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Millennials rejoice! This one is for you. Are you ready to bring back the loud colors, dive deep into pop culture, wear everything tie-dye, and venture into the raver’s paradise?

          <p># What is CHIPS?
Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox proposal that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
A partitioned third-party cookie is tied to the top-level site where it&#x27;s initially set and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. The aim is to allow cookies to be set by a third-party service, but only read within the context of the top-level site where they were initially set.
# Who is the origin trial for?
This trial is available as a third-party origin trial, which enables providers of embedded content to try out a new feature across multiple sites.
If a site enrolls in the trial as a first-party, the cookie partitioning functionality will be available to any third-party content …</p>

          <p>So, you bought a code signing certificate for your Electron app. One step closer to being able to release your app on Windows. Congrats!
Finally, 3 weeks later, after a few phone calls, Sectigo issued the certificate. Woohoo! The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.
In their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).
And then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.
So you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo? Haha nope,…</p>

          <p>Over the last decade, we’ve had the honor to welcome talented Ukrainian creatives to this community: more than 94,000 Dribbble designers and 1,200 Creative Market shops are based in Ukraine. On February 24, their lives and dreams were suddenly shattered by conflict. According to the UNHCR, the number of civilians fleeing Ukraine has now reached 2 million, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.
At Dribbble, we believe creativity thrives when human beings are free to design their lives without fear of violence. That’s why we’re partnering with the International Rescue Committee to provide relief to Ukrainians seeking refuge. Their teams are on the ground in Poland providing critical aid to families fleeing the conflict and trying to gain control over their future. Dribbble will donate $50,000 USD to this cause.
Over the coming days, we will also showcase Ukrainian creators across our platforms. We encourage you to support their extraordinary design work on Dribbble and ready-to-use assets on Creative Market’s new Finds Page.
We’re here to empower creatives to make a living doing what they love, in peace.

If you miss the days when all the youths donned Air Jordans, MTV actually played music, Fresh Prince was on regularly scheduled programming, and troll dolls adorned the dashboard of every oversized car, then you’re a true 80s kid at heart.
Continuing our Design by the Decades series, here is the 80s Edition. Interested in the 70s? Check out 70s graphic design trends to inspire you.
Exploring 80s graphic design trends
It turns out that a lot of those 80s trends have returned in modern times, so you’re in luck if you’re nostalgic for some good old 80s vibes. Remember the velvet couch that Grandma never got rid of? Well, it’s back in style! Use it as a gorgeous design component in your home renovation project. Let’s just vow to leave teased hai…</p>

          <p>Continuing with my JavaScript fun, I wanted to do an updated pass on the horizontal navs I’ve previously built for both GitHub Mobile (prior to the current responsive version and native apps) and this Bootstrap dashboard example.
The goal? Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.
Here’s the final demo via CodePen.

          <p>We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:
That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.
That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.
That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.
That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.
That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.
That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.
That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.
That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.
That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.
Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.
I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.</p>

          <p>February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.
Survived the freeze
Texas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.

a while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).
So I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:
* Learning: Classic front/back prompts to memorize things. Think &quot;What is the capital of Argentina?&quot; on the front and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; on the back. Works with a spaced repetition algorithm so time between prompts is optimized.
* Habits: Recurring actions you want to do - you can set the frequency individually. For example &quot;Stand up and …</p>

along with news from across the project—and the beginning of 2022 has
plenty of updates.
# Privacy Sandbox on Android
If you have been watching the Privacy Sandbox site, you may have noticed changes
to the structure as we introduced the Privacy Sandbox on
Android.
&quot;We’re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on
Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions.
Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data …</p>

Chrome 100 beta was released on March 3, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late March, 2022.
# Last Version for Unreduced User-Agent String
Chromium 100 will be the last version to support an unreduced User-Agent string by default (as well as the related navigator.userAgent, navigator.appVersion, and navigator.platform DOM APIs). The origin trial that allowed sites to test the fully reduced User-Agent will end on April 19, 2022. After that date, the User-Agent String will be gradually reduced. To review the whole schedule, see Chromium Blog: User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial and Dates. Sites that need more time to test or migrate to User-Agent Client Hints can enroll in the deprecation origin…</p>

          <p>It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve used an RSS feed reader. But everytime I try to get back to using it, I start by (re)installing Feedly, getting furstated by the lack of (what i believe are) key features. Try a bunch of other readers at random, getting fed up, and leave again.
This time, I&#x27;m determined not to let ignorance about good readers stop me.

          <p>In a world of shaders, meshes, and filters, Canvas2D might not get you excited.
But it should! 30-40% of web pages have a  element and 98% of all canvases use a Canvas2D rendering context.
There are Canvas2Ds in cars, on fridges, and in space (really).
Admittedly, the API is a bit behind the times when it comes to state-of-the-art 2D drawing.
Fortunately we&#x27;ve been hard at work implementing new features in Canvas2D to catch up to CSS, streamline ergonomics and improve performance.
# Part 1: catching up with CSS
CSS has a few drawing commands that are sorely missing from Canvas2D. With the new API we&#x27;ve added a handful of the most requested features:

The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…
Sometimes the compromise is worth it.…</p>

          <p>During my recovery I’ve made it a point to double down on improving my rather limited JavaScript skills. Courses have been helpful, but it seems that no matter the course, I do my best learning by making things myself. So I’ve been tinkering around and trying to build some new projects.
My latest experiment was to build something that allows me to toggle a class on an element with a particular id.


  Toggle



  This element will have the .blue class toggled on it.



The gist is that I want to use a  to toggle any class I want on another element of my choosing, all using data attributes so that it’s infinitely flexible and functional in any context.

          <p>I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.
Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.
With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.

ふるさとの街やかれ
身よりの骨うめし焼土に
今は白い花咲く
ああ許すまじ原爆を    
三度許すまじ原爆を    
われらの街に

ふるさとの海荒れて
黒き雨喜びの日はなく
今は舟に人もなし
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの海に

ふるさとの空重く
黒き雲今日も大地おおい
今は空に陽もささず
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの空に

はらからのたえまなき
労働にきずきあぐ富と幸
今はすべてついえ去らん
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を

The city of my hometown
We buried the charred bones of our relatives
White flowers are blooming now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our city

The sea of my hometown is rough
There is no day of joy in black rain
There are no people in the boats now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sea

The sky of my hometown
Black clouds, the earth is covered today
Now the sun isn&#x27;t in the sky
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sky

No praise from the belly
Wealth and happiness is labor
I can&#x27;t leave everything now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
On top of the world</p>

          <p>Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.

Recently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).
Often we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)
One thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.
Tools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.

I‚Äôm financially engaged with Kevin and I like Texas BBQ, so I thought I‚Äôd go. I also thought my former neighbor Cleo was going to be there and wouldn‚Äôt it be fun to surprise her.
Cleo didn‚Äôt show up. Foiled! I thought she always went to this thing. Ugh. Okay. Reset. I made due, grabbed a plat of free BBQ and sat down. I was now on my own in a sea of retirees running the same free BBQ grift I was running. There were two people under 60: my financial advisor and the person he invited to be the guest speaker. I failed at making small talk, so my tablemates and I sat the long table poking at our meats and the conversation centered around passing the potato salad.

                    <span>This week I came across an article titled ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt video games take sex seriously?‚Äù‚Ä¶ so naturally I clicked it. I was pleased to find the article featured Robert Yang, one of my favorite game designers that I follow on Twitter. I like Yang because our lives are so entirely dissimilar; I‚Äôm a straight white guy who makes corporate websites and he‚Äôs a gay asian man who makes a lot of homoerotic sex simulator games. If I recall correctly, I started following him about five years ago because of this tweet about level design and I was hooked. Even though I‚Äôm not the target audience of his controversial (but yet not controversial) games, I admire and appreciate Yang‚Äôs work.

Let‚Äôs level set a bit and talk a bit about the different flavors of wiggle room:

                    <span>The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it‚Äôs sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.
Episode six is all about design principles. That‚Äôs a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.
But for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.
Katie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite‚Äôs time for her to talk me through it. I‚Äôve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.
It‚Äôs nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.

And with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!</span>

Overview #
Users are often presented with items, sometimes lots of items, and in these
cases it can be a good idea to provide a way to reduce the list to prevent
choice overload. This
blog post explores filtering UI as a way to reduce choices. It does this by
presenting item attributes that users can select or deselect, reducing results
and therefore reducing choice overload.

The goal is to enable swift traversal of filter options for all users and their
varying input types. This will be delivered with an adaptable and responsive

For this virtual hack day of 2021, we had a dedicated focus: Cop26 and the environment.

We produced and presented 19 amazing hacks over the two-day event, including a tool to read product ingredients and determine if they are vegan or not, a visualisation of the world showing data about temperature changes over the last century, an app for extending the life of all your belongings and keeping them out of landfill and an app that uses data from waqi.io to provide the quality of air by location.

I&#x27;m Ian Kilpatrick,
an engineering lead on the Blink layout team, along with Koji Ishii.
Before working on the Blink team,
I was a front-end engineer (before Google had the role of &quot;front-end engineer&quot;),
building features within Google Docs, Drive, and Gmail.
After around five years in that role I took a large gamble switching to the Blink team,
effectively learning C++ on the job,
and attempting to ramp up on the massively complex Blink codebase.
Even today, I only understand a relatively small portion of it.
I&#x27;m grateful for the time given to me during this period.

Any request that comes from the site and any response it gets back first goes through the service worker file.</span>

September was a good month, a month of rebirth. New projects, rebooting stalled projects, pool closing, kids in school; a rhythm. Walks, boats, ebooks, I even bought a new iPad Mini to support my YouTube and RSS habits. Today my daughter turns six and I‚Äôm particularly sensitive to the passage of time. Lots of sunshine, lots of roses, but this month did bring with it some bad news.
Some highlights‚Ä¶

The big news is that Shop Talk started a YouTube series. It‚Äôs thrice weekly‚Äôish, 10~20 minute videos over on the CSS Tricks YouTube channel. I wrote a bit about it, but Chris and I are having a good time making videos. We‚Äôre up to 12 videos so far. That‚Äôs a helluva cadence so there‚Äôll be some breaks, but so far feels pretty sustainable.

                    <span>Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn‚Äôt support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#x27; lives easier.

                    <span>Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn‚Äôt support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users&#x27; lives easier.

                    <span>Welcome to the latest post in our ‚ÄòDay in the Life‚Äô blog series, in which product and engineering‚Äôs digital coordinator, Rasha Ardati, interviews a colleague from the department to reflect on their career and experiences at the Guardian.
When Roberto was 10 years old, he went to the library with his dad. There was a little computer in the corner that caught his interest and he left with every book on computing he could find. At home, Roberto took out a pad of paper and started writing his first code. Years later, when Roberto decided he probably couldn‚Äôt follow his original dream of being a mathematician, he decided to pursue a career in computing.
What was the path that eventually brought you to the Guardian?

                    <span>A new episode of the Clearleft podcast just dropped and I have to say, this is one of my favourites so far. It‚Äôs all about measuring design.
There was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn‚Äôt there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?
For this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.
This episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it‚Äôs well worth your time. Have a listen.

This is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!</span>

                    <span>Applications deal with untrusted strings all the time, but safely rendering that content as part of an HTML document can be tricky. Without sufficient care, it&#x27;s easy to accidentally create opportunities for cross-site scripting (XSS) that malicious attackers may exploit.
To mitigate that risk, the new Sanitizer API proposal aims to build a robust processor for arbitrary strings to be safely inserted into a page. This article introduces the API, and explains its usage.

                    <span>Bootstrap v5.1.2 is here with a handful of improvements across our components, plus a fix for an issue in another project that prevented our Sass from compiling properly. Keep reading for the highlights.
Highlights
Temporarily patched a postcss-values-parser issue by rearranging our calc() functions that use negative numbers. This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap‚Äôs Sass in create-react-app.
Added border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects
Added align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers
Fixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children
Updated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN
Improved docs around .img-fluid
Added role&#x3D;&quot;switch&quot; to our form switches in our docs
Implemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.
Up next
Up next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we‚Äôll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.
Get the release
Head to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It‚Äôs also been pushed to npm:
npm i bootstrap

                    <span>Many sites use third-party embeds to create an engaging user experience by delegating some sections of a web page to another content provider. The most common examples of third-party content embeds are video players, social-media feeds, maps, and advertisements.
Third-party content can impact the performance of a page in many ways. It can be render-blocking, contend with other critical resources for network and bandwidth, or affect the Core Web Vitals metrics. Third-party embeds may also cause layout shifts as they load. This article discusses performance best practices that you can use when loading third-party embeds, efficient loading techniques, and the Layout Shift Terminator tool that helps reduce layout shifts for popular embeds.

In C++, ruling out the possibility of data races comes down to a small thread-safety correctness proof for every data member access.
These proofs add up to a lot of mental toil, especially when reviewing or refactoring code.
Clang&#x27;s static analysis framework takes over the toil of thread-safety proofs.
# Add GUARDED_BY_CONTEXT() to data members in thread-unsafe classes
Most Chrome classes are thread-unsafe, and should be used on a single sequence.
Add annotations to all data members that are not thread-safe.
Unnecessary annotations are safe, but missing annotations are a risk of data races.

                    <span>On this day twenty years ago I wrote the first entry in my online journal. In the intervening two decades I‚Äôve written a further 2,817 entries.
I am now fifty years old, which means I‚Äôve been blogging for two fifths of my lifetime.
My website has actually been around for longer than twenty years, but its early incarnations had no blog. That all changed when I relaunched the site on September 30th, 2001.
I wrote at the time:
I‚Äôm not quite sure what I will be saying here over the coming days, weeks, months and years.
Honestly I still feel like that.
I think it‚Äôs safe to assume an ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù attitude for what I post here. Being a web developer, there‚Äôs bound to be lots of geeky, techy stuff but I also want a place where I can rant and rave about life in general.
That‚Äôs been pretty true, ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We‚Äôre past the halfway mark for this season of the Clearleft podcast. Episode four came out today. It‚Äôs all about innovation.
At the beginning of the episode, I think you can hear the scorn in my voice. Y‚Äôsee, innovation is one of the words‚Äîlike ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù‚Äîthat gets thrown around a lot and everyone assumes it only has positive connotations. But words like ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù and ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù can be applied to endeavours that are not good for the world.
Bitcoin, for example, could rightly be described as innovative (and disruptive) but it‚Äôs also a planet-destroying ponzi scheme‚Äîlike a lovechild of the trolley problem and the paperclip maximizer designed to generate the most amount of waste for the least amount of value.
So, yeah, I‚Äôm not a fan of innovation for innovation‚Äôs sake. But don‚Äôt worry. For this episode of the podcast I set my personal feelings to one side and let the episode act as a conduit for much smarter people.
The whole thing clocks in at 25 minutes but I think this episode might have the widest range of contributors yet. There are snippets from an internal Clearleft discussion, soundbites from a panel discussion, extracts from conference talks, as well as interviews with individuals. From Clearleft there‚Äôs Chris How, Andy Thornton, Jon Aizlewood and Lorenzo Ferronato. From the panel discussion there‚Äôs Janna Bastow, Matt Cooper-Wright, Dorota Biniecka and Akshan Ish. And from UX Fest there‚Äôs Radhika Dutt, Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein.
I happily defer to their expertise on this topic. Have a listen and hear what they have to say.</span>

                    <span>Each season of the Clearleft podcast has six episodes. Three of the six episodes of the current season are available with another three still to come.
In case you missed them, the episodes of season three released so far are:
Coaching
What‚Äôs the difference between training, coaching, and mentorship?
Design Engineering
A role that sits at the intersection‚Äîor rather, the gap‚Äîbetween design and engineering.
Design Research
The journey from evaluative research to generative research.
That‚Äôs quite a mixed bag. You might think that there‚Äôs no particular unifying to a season of the podcast.
Well, that‚Äôs kind of true. There‚Äôs no specific theme. But each season does have a meta-grouping.
At Clearleft, we think about our services in three interconnected categories: explore, create, and grow.
‚ÄúExplore‚Äù is all about the big strategic picture.
‚ÄúCreate‚Äù is the nitty-gritty work of delivery.
‚ÄúGrow‚Äù is what connects those together.
Each season of the podcast focuses on one of those categories. This season it‚Äôs all about ‚Äúexplore‚Äù with a bit of ‚Äúgrow‚Äù thrown in.
The next three episodes of this season will double down on the big-picture thinking. I don‚Äôt want to give any spoilers, but I‚Äôll just remind you that if you‚Äôre not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, I highly recommend rectifying that situation.

# Keyword Spam Update
Keyword Spam is the practice of including irrelevant or excessive keywords in an extensions
description in an attempt to manipulate its ranking, resulting in a spammy, negative user
experience. We don&#x27;t allow extensions with misleading, improperly formatted, non-descriptive,
irrelevant, excessive, or inappropriate metadata, including but ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Developers are constantly wondering about what kind of audience they are
developing for. Are they using high end devices with large RAM? What connection
are they using (for example Wi-Fi, 2G) and so on. The answers to these questions
can affect product development decisions such as choosing the
technologies to render the content. This report provides timeline data to inform
developers on these questions for a list of countries, such as the US, Brazil,
Japan, and others. Three platforms are included when data is available: Android,
Windows, and ChromeOS.
Looking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to
think about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of
users have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in
the US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another
example: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices
have RAM larger than 5¬†GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower
than India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help
developers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device
characteristics.
This data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.
In Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google
to help improve Chrome&#x27;s feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash
reports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled
during installation or in Chrome&#x27;s settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,
and metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable
with other datasets.  If the metrics collection is re-enabled, the unique
identifier will also be reset. We used the data collected to calculate the
various statistics in this
report.

                    <span>üéâ After nearly ten years of weekly podcasts, Shop Talk has entered into a new realm: Video. Under the umbrella of the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel we‚Äôve started posting daily-ish videos about front-end web development. This is a üî• year for CSS, so there‚Äôs no shortage of topics or #hotdrama to talk about and demo.
We‚Äôre still dialing in the formula, but it‚Äôs shaping up to look like 15~20 minute videos delivered thrice weekly. Math-wise, that‚Äôs not too different than doing another one hour podcast every week. Video of course is a little more involved, you need to spend a bit more effort planning out tech demos. Keeping our same (overly?) casual feel makes it all sustainable for us. If Chris and I were doing video content full time it might make sense to write and edit a bit more, but both of us have day jobs, are running companies, and contributing code.
One nice by-product of exploring video is that we get a chance to re-explain mouth-coding examples or overly visual concepts that were probably confusing on the audio podcast. As much as I love podcasting, the lack of visual examples for a visual field like Web Design and Development is a limitation. I like that the YouTube series is like supplementary material to ideas covered in the podcast, rather than a replacement.
Okay! That‚Äôs it! I hope you enjoy the little foray into video.

And I wouldn‚Äôt be a YouTuber if I didn‚Äôt say‚Ä¶ Be sure to drop a like and subscribe, that really helps us out in the algorithm. And ring that bell for notifications when new videos come out.</span>

                    <span>Resource hints, such as preconnect,
preload,
prefetch, and
prerender, help
the browser figure out which resources will the user need in the near future.
preconnect and preload are declarative hints‚Äîthe browser must act on
them, so use them when you are sure that a resource will be required during the
next load.
prefetch and prerender are speculative hints‚Äîuse these to recommend that
the browser should fetch a certain resource because there&#x27;s a high chance it
might be required.
This article focuses on speculative prefetching and prerendering. Learn more about
how they&#x27;re used, the drawbacks of the current implementations, and popular external
libraries that implement sophisticated speculation. Enhancements that bring same-origin
speculative prerendering to the browser are under development ‚Ä¶</span>

Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model‚Äîa definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content‚Äîwith my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer‚Äôs omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Six years ago, I started a good blogging habit of writing down any idea I had as a draft post. This was a good practice because the idea was now out of my head and I wouldn‚Äôt stay up at night thinking about it. Over time that grew to about eighty posts in different states of completeness and it became overwhelming. 16,000+ words, terribly organized.
A flat folder full of alphabetically sorted markdown files was not intuitively useful. I had no idea which posts were most recent, which were almost done, and which needed to go away. Lots of those drafts were a zingy title and a vague one-liner of text. Reverse engineering my own ideas when I revisited them later was difficult. It became mentally taxing to manage my own blog.

version for the
Chrome extension ecosystem. Years in the making, Manifest V3 is more secure, performant, and

into consideration both the changing web landscape and the future of browser extensions.
As we look to the future by continuing to iterate on and improve upon Manifest V3 functionality, we
also want to share details about the plan to phase out Manifest V2 extensions.
There are two key dates for the phase-out:

# FTP support removed
Chrome is removing support for FTP
URLs. Use of FTP in the
browser is sufficiently low that it is no longer viable to invest in improving
the existing FTP client. In addition, more capable FTP clients are available on
all affected platforms.
Google Chrome 72 and later removed support for fetching document subresources
over FTP and rendering of top level FTP resources. Currently navigating to FTP
URLs results in showing a directory listing or a download depending on the type
of resource. A bug in Google Chrome 74 and later resulted in dropping support for
accessing FTP URLs ‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>We‚Äôre halfway through the third season of the Clearleft podcast already!
Episode three is all about design research. I like the narrative structure of this. It‚Äôs a bit like a whodunnit, but it‚Äôs more like a whydunnit. The ‚Äúwhy‚Äù question is ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt companies hiring more researchers?‚Äù
The scene of the crime is this year‚Äôs UX Fest, where talks by both Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein uncovered the shocking lack of researchers. From there, I take up the investigation with Maite Otondo and Stephanie Troeth.
I won‚Äôt spoil it but by the end there‚Äôs an answer to the mystery.
I learned a lot along the way too. I realised how many axes of research there are. There‚Äôs qualitative research (stories, emotion, and context) and then there‚Äôs quantitative research (volume and data). But there‚Äôs also evualative research (testing a hyphothesis) and generative research (exploring a problem space before creating a solution). By my count that gives four possible combos: qualitative evaluative research, quantitative evaluative research, qualitative generative research, and quantitative generative research. Phew!
Steph was a terrific guest. Only a fraction of our conversation made it into the episode, but we chatted for ages.
And Maite kind of blew my mind too, especially when she was talking about the relationship between research and design and she said:
Research is about the present and design is about the future.
ü§Ø
I‚Äôm going to use that quote again in a future episode. In fact, this episode on design research leads directly into the next two episodes. You won‚Äôt want to miss them. So if you‚Äôre not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, you should get on that, whether it‚Äôs via the RSS feed, Apple, Google, Spotify, Overcast, or wherever you get your podcasts from.
Have a listen to this episode on design research and if you‚Äôre a researcher yourself, remember that unlike most companies we value research at Clearleft and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre hiring another researcher right now. Come and work with us!</span>

# New CSS length authoring tools
DevTools added an easier yet flexible way to update lengths in CSS!
In the Styles pane, look for any CSS property with length (e.g. height, padding).
Hover over the unit type, and notice the unit type is underlined. Click on it to select a unit type from the dropdown.
          
Hover over the unit value, and your mouse pointer is changed to horizontal cursor. Drag horizontally to increase or decrease the value. To adjust the value by 10, hold the Shift key when dragging.
          
You can still edit the unit value as text ‚Äî just click on the value and start editing.

I wanted a more open alternative. I decided to build a little image service that would fetch the icon from any web site, optimize it using Eleventy Image, and return that instead.
Demo #
     
If you want a live demo in the wild, check out the Eleventy Leaderboards (via Speedlify).
Source Code #
https://github.com/11ty/api-indieweb-avatar
Only one path parameter is supported right now: /[url]/ (must be encoded via e.g. encodeURIComponent)
My version is running on https://v1.indieweb-avatar.11ty.dev/ using the same versioning via Netlify Branch Subdomains strategy as the screenshot and sparkline services.
It makes use of Netlify‚Äôs On-Demand Builders to reduce the number of external HTTP requests to generate the images.

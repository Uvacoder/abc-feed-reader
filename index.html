It detailed how many of the tactics and thought processes anyone who came of age in the 90s would recognize as &quot;of the right&quot; are now being used by the opposite side of the political spectrum. A clip:

Conservatives once tried to legislate what went on in your bedroom; now it’s the left that obsesses over sexual codicils, not just for the bedroom but everywhere. Right-wingers from time to time made headlines campaigning against everything from The Last Temptation of Christ to “Fuck the Police,” though we laughed at the idea that Ice Cube made cops literally unsafe, and it was understood an artist had to do something fairly ambitious, like piss on a crucifix in public, to get conservative protesters off their couche…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The advent of import maps, and the bundler-less JavaScript reality it introduced, was undoubtedly my favorite advancement in web tech for 2021. Between Guy Bedford&#x27;s excellent shim and native support in Chrome 89, we&#x27;ve finally been granted an escape from a decade&#x27;s worth of frustrating complexity with excess tooling.
Usually progress means more to learn, more to master. It&#x27;s not often we get to celebrate the progress of true conceptual compression, so when we do, the confetti is well deserved. Hurrah for import maps!
Thus I&#x27;m thrilled to announce that HEY has been running on import maps in production for the past two weeks, and the experience has been bliss. An entire class of problems flushed from the daily development experience. WOOSH.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By Leo Babauta So many of us feel a scarcity of time: we feel rushed, like there’s not enough time to do everything, always behind, never feeling like we’re doing enough. This problem is called “time scarcity,” and it’s one of the most common stresses in our society. So how do we deal with this? […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When the web.dev team at Google contacted Clearleft about writing a course on responsive design, our eyes lit up.
This was clearly a good fit. For one thing, Clearleft has been pioneering responsive design from day one—we helped launch some of the first responsive sites in the UK. But there was another reason why this partnership sounded good: we had the same approach to writing and sharing.
Ever since Clearleft was founded in 2005 we’ve taken on board the motto of the World Wide Web itself: let’s share what we know. As well as doing the work, we enjoy sharing how the work gets done. Whether it’s case studies, blog posts, podcasts, or conference talks, we’re always thinking about ways to contribute to the web community.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the things I get the most questions about from my students is about what the “best way” to structure code is.
The truth is, there is no best way. But I do have a series of conventions and rough guidelines that I follow. Today, I thought I’d share them with you.
Let’s dig in!
The JavaScript patterns I use I have a small handful of JavaScript patterns I use, depending on the needs of the project.</p>

Recently I was following issue #17380 [0] &quot;No router advertisements sent out over wireguard link&quot; which resulted in PR #21692 [1] &quot;network: wireguard: allow to start ndisc or radv&quot;.
Shortly after the issue was closed Jason Donenfeld (alias zx2c4 - author of Wireguard) added a comment [2]:
&quot;Please revert this. WireGuard does not work with LLv6 by design.&quot;
As a strong proponent and designer/developer/operator of IPv6-only networks and services I was unpleasantly surprised by this comment since we rely on IPv6 link-local functionality and also use Wireguard extensively including with link-local addresses and try to e…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I finally had a chance to read ILSR&#x27;s blockbuster report on Amazon&#x27;s squeeze of independent retailers who sell through their marketplace. It&#x27;s unusually well-written and researched, and the picture it paints is depressingly familiar to anyone who&#x27;ve been at the sharp end of a big tech monopoly spear.
The overarching conclusion is that the squeeze is accelerating, and that the average all-in cut Amazon extracts from independent retailers on their marketplace has shot up from 19% to 30% in the last five years. Magically arriving at the same exorbitant rate that Apple and Google are taking in their digital marketplaces.
This has been achieved by tying more and more overpriced-but-necessary services to its basic 15% cut. First Amazon basically made it a requirement to use them for storage and …</p>

The last few modules in particular were unexplored areas for me, with topics like screen configurations and media features. I learned a lot about those topics by writing about them.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This week, we’ve looked at various techniques for looping over arrays and objects.
In both articles I noted:
 in a real site or application, you might want to manipulate the data in some way.
 Today, we’re going to look at how to mutate and transform arrays. Let’s dig in!
An example array For today’s article, lets use an array of wizards as an example. Each item in the array is an object with the wizard’s name and signature spell.</p>

            >Ask HN: I&#x27;m terrible at design (back end dev)</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the years I&#x27;ve started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked and couldn&#x27;t improve them.
Common advice for people like me is to use a framework and/or template. I&#x27;ve used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I&#x27;ve spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.
I&#x27;ve also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.
It&#x27;s hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello!
In the last few months I&#x27;ve worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.codedraft
The main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that&#x27;s why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.
Another feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https://app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.
The web app can also be opened from the &quot;Scan Code&quot; tab in the mobile app.
I&#x27;ve always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.
Let me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!

While the French president is talking about &quot;pissing off the unvaccinated&quot;, the Australians are trying to a martyr of Djokovic, and the Americans continue to render everything virus through the basic two-way political tribal lens, Denmark is doing something else.
I already wrote about the curious state of affairs that in a country with extremely high levels of trust in government, just 40% of parents have decided to vaccinate their 5-11 year-old kids. Despite a strong, persistent recommendation from the health authorities to do so. Well, that was two weeks ago. The vaccination rate hasn&#x27;t budged since.

            >HTML is general, ARIA is specific</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed 
 element should have, if any…
The proposed 
 element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a 
 or a  but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?
All good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.
What struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.
HTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. 
? Sure, that can be a div. ? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. ? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a  and a  for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.
There’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Visit ChromeStatus.com for lists of current deprecations and previous removals.
Chrome 98 beta was released on January 6, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in early February, 2022.
# Remove SDES key exchange for WebRTC
The SDES key exchange mechanism for WebRTC has been declared a MUST NOT in the
relevant IETF standards since 2013. Its usage in Chrome has declined
significantly over the last year. SDES is
removed because it is a
security problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that
entities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert
the Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.
# Deprecation policy
To keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform
which have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an
API, such as:
They are superseded by newer APIs.
They are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and
consistency with other browsers.
They are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and
thus can increase the burden of support for web developers.
Some of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To
mitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they
can make the required changes to keep their sites running.
Chrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of
API&#x27;s,
essentially:
Announce on the
blink-dev
mailing list.
Set warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage
is detected on the page.
Wait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.
You can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the
deprecated filter and
removed features by applying the removed
filter. We will also try to
summarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">JavaScript provides a handful of methods and techniques for looping over arrays and elements and doing things with them. So… which approach should you use, and why?
Today, we’re going to look at the different ways you can loop over things with vanilla JS, and when and why to choose one over the other.
Let’s dig in!

Sandbox, tracking the milestones on
the path to phasing out third-party cookies in Chrome and working towards a more
private web. Normally, we share an overview of updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline along with news from across
the project, but December was a quiet month. Instead, we&#x27;ll look back at some of
the activities over 2021 and provide a few potential resolutions you can make
now we are in the new year.
# Chromium development process
For a new web platform feature to land in Chromium, it needs to go through the
project&#x27;s open development

Reassigning the variable Let’s say you have an array of wizards, like this.
let wizards &#x3D; [&#x27;Gandalf&#x27;, &#x27;Radagast&#x27;, &#x27;Merlin&#x27;];  You want to completely wipe it out. The most common way to do this is to reassign the value of the wizards variable to an empty array ([]).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.
Still, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.
In 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.
It all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public
websites as part of the
Private Network Access (PNA)
specification.
Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private
network request for a subresource, which asks
for explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will
carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the
response to it must carry a corresponding header,
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
targeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have
affected hundreds of thousands of users,
allowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite
gradient flavors.
In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an
evolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by
adding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse
for crisp and compact font files that compress well.
Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports
COLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.
# Color now
On the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does
not define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be
placed. That&#x27;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a
color. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that to…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This is not the same as being creative. In fact, they’re very different skills and emotional mindsets. All humans are creative. Sometimes. Creativity is a special sort of internal conversation, an opportunity to see a problem or a situation and then produce something that dances with it. But shipping creative work is a cultural and […]</p>

            >It&#x27;s not a lottery</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there&#x27;s already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I&#x27;m just left thinking: What&#x27;s the point? Do people think this is a lottery?
This isn&#x27;t unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don&#x27;t even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?
Maybe that&#x27;s part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don&#x27;t even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I&#x27;m skeptical.
Either way, it&#x27;s not how we review applications at Basecamp. There&#x27;s a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don&#x27;t comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a &quot;manager of managers&quot; for the director of engineering).
You might think, what&#x27;s the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that&#x27;s it. But I think there&#x27;s a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I&#x27;m not getting callbacks, so I&#x27;ll put even less effort into the next opening.
I guess what I&#x27;m saying is make the effort or don&#x27;t bother. We&#x27;re not drawing names out of a hat here.</p>

            >It&#x27;s harder hiring managers</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We just opened a position for a Director of Engineering to help us manage our rapidly expanding technical teams at Basecamp. We already have more programmers on staff than we&#x27;ve ever had, and we intend to double that crew within the next 12-18 months. We&#x27;re going all-in on becoming a multi-product business again, and that means hiring the managers needed to to cope with those ambitions.
Not just because of this rapid growth on the technical teams, but because the rest of the company is growing along with it. We&#x27;ll be bigger than we&#x27;ve ever been this January, and before the end of the year, we&#x27;ll be much bigger still. Wild to think that after almost twenty years in business, we&#x27;re suddenly on a fast track to crack a hundred employees.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team&#x27;s work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what&#x27;s happening across the company.
The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it&#x27;s a book, it&#x27;s obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn&#x27;t like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let&#x27;s look at something that was posted internally, today.

            >Faith in eventually</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.

During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.

There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.

It’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.

This is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.

Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it&#x27;s never right even after.

In the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!

WebTransport is a new option for sending real time messages

You can use feature detection to see what

Searching arrays from the end becomes a little
easier.

# Web Transport
If you&#x27;re using Web Sockets or the WebRTC Data Channel API to send messages
between your server and the page, there&#x27;s a new option for you. WebTransport
is a new API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.
It has lower latency than WebSockets, and unlike the RTC Data Channel API,
which is designed for peer-to-peer messaging, the Web Transport API is
specifically designed for client-se…</p>

 One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you don’t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I grew up with persistent reminders of how any bad thing that happened could easily have been worse. Oh, you scraped your knee? It could be worse, you could have broken your leg! Oh, you broke your leg? It could be worse, you could have cracked your skull! Oh, you cracked your skull? It could be worse, you could have died!
It wasn&#x27;t just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control. The way to make those setbacks and the inevitable suffering in life bearable was to constantly remind yourself that... it could be worse!
Any student of Stoicism will recognize this pattern of mental fortification. It&#x27;s closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality. And the ultimate resilience to face the struggles of living lies in controlling our reactions to the things that happen. Our reactions are not given. They can be changed.
I wish there was more of that today. More &quot;it could be worse&quot;. Less &quot;this is the worst thing ever&quot;.</p>

When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us.

One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">2020 was the year of the virus. 2021 was the year of the vaccine …and the virus, obviously, but still it felt like the year we fought back. With science!
Whenever someone writes and shares one of these year-end retrospectives the result is, by its very nature, personal. These last two years are different though. We all still have our own personal perspectives, but we also all share a collective experience of The Ongoing Situation.
Like, I can point to three pivotal events in 2021 and I bet you could point to the same three for you:
getting my first vaccine shot in March,

In this article for Codrops we’ll look at how to use them together, to create an interactive timeline that’s both scrollable and draggable. We’ll be building a timeline showing the albums of the rock band Radiohead — but you can choose any subject matter you like!

In the year that went, every single application we offer had at least 99.99% uptime! This is through repeated AWS outages, zero-day security alerts, and the drama of the world in those twelve months.
But it gets better. Basecamp 3 had an uptime of 99.997%. HEY pipped it by a point with 99.998% uptime. And Basecamp 2 hit the mythical five nines with 99.999% uptime! I believe that is the best reliability record we&#x27;ve ever achieved for a full year in our almost twenty year history as a software company. Worth a toast!
It&#x27;s the result of years of investments in things like active-active double data center deployments for our on-premise apps like Basecamp 2 and 3. …</p>

To some, it may mean to be at the top in every sense, ahead of everyone; and to some, it may mean chasing perfection.  


But what happens when you reach the “pinnacle” of Success? 


How do you stay a winner when you’re already at the top, and there’s nowhere else to go? How do you maintain that winning streak that syncs your flow through life? And most importantly how do you reap the possibilities created through ‘The Winning’?


“You and your organization, are most vulnerable when you are most successful.” – Robin Sharma, The Greatness Guide 


A real win is when you truly feel happy from within, and not vulnerable – Which can only happen when you can ‘Stop Worrying and Start Living.’

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">As my year in reading goes, I&#x27;ve certainly read less books, but I&#x27;ve not spent less time reading. It&#x27;s just some books take me longer than others. For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it&#x27;s really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn&#x27;t count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site&#x27;s data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I&#x27;ve read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On the face of it, this seems like a basic medical question. One where reasonable people can weigh the same trade offs, yet arrive at different conclusions. And, as foreign as that might seem to Americans at the moment, that&#x27;s largely how this question has been tackled in Denmark in the public forum so far.
There are Danish pediatricians arguing that the determining factor should be that kids themselves don&#x27;t stand to benefit much from the vaccine. That the Danish principle on vaccines has up until this point weighed protecting the vaccinated themselves as the number one goal. And thus Denmark should not recommend the vaccine for kids broadly.
Then there are the health authorities saying that regardless of whether the vaccines are likely to help the individual kid, it&#x27;s important that they…</p>

CSS
There hasn’t been one single new CSS feature in 2021 that’s captured my attention above all others. But CSS continues to evolve and keep pace with developers’ needs. It’s great to see browsers coming through with widespread support for aspect-ratio. I’ve been using min(), max() and clamp() a lot more now that they’re widely supported, and finding them super convenient. And there are a lot of exciting new CSS features just over the horizon — some of which browsers are already beginning to implement. Her…</p>

The mantra for the year was “No goals, only vibes” and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.

😃 Paid off our car!

End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.
But we made it.
The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained.

Elsewhere in 2021 I published two seasons of the Clearleft podcast (12 episodes), and I wrote the 15 modules that comprise a course on responsive design on web.dev.
Most of my speaking engagements in 2021 were online though I did manage a little bit of travel in between COVID waves.
My travel map for the year includes one transatlantic trip: Christmas in Arizona, where I’m writing this end-of-year wrap-up before getting back on a plane to England tomorrow, Omicron willing.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I read 26 books in 2021, which is a bit more than I read in 2020. That said, some of them were brief books. I don’t think I actually read any more than my usual annual allotment of words.
I’m glad that I’m tracking my reading here on my own site. About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.
I continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.
Now that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…</p>

            >Does it make you enjoy?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My friend and I have been discussing cars.
He&#x27;s thinking of buying his first fancy one.
His dad had one years ago, and he&#x27;s thought about buying a car like this — like his dad&#x27;s — for years. He&#x27;s stressed over it, he&#x27;s agonized over it, and he&#x27;s spent a few too many hours thinking about all the reasons why and why not.
This morning he told me he was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make him happy.
Of course it won&#x27;t, I said. But that&#x27;s the wrong question.
The better question is &quot;Will I enjoy it?&quot;
Making you happy is too high a bar for anything. It&#x27;s unfair to ask that of anyone or anything — it&#x27;s something you can really only ask yourself, or bring yourself.
But enjoying something? That&#x27;s possible! It&#x27;s very much within reach.
So I said, will you enjoy the car? Could you see yourself enjoying the car? Will you enjoy the drive?
And that&#x27;s a much easier question to answer. And an expectation that&#x27;s easier to accept.
Objects (and experiences) don&#x27;t make you anything, you have to enjoy them.
Enjoying something is plenty.
I think he&#x27;s going to buy one.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn&#x27;t the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of &quot;millennium type problems&quot;. Using air quotes in my description because I&#x27;m fairly sure this is a patronising statement I&#x27;m making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they&#x27;re left feeling empty. Obviously it&#x27;s an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I&#x27;ve already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex&#x27;s personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, so Chamber&#x27;s settles with using the &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with &quot;it&quot; and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is &quot;they&quot;. This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn&#x27;t happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber&#x27;s wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won&#x27;t cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.</p>

            >6 Ways to Increase the Odds of Success</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Have you ever wanted to improve or become more successful in an area of your life, thought you were committed to making the change, but then didn&#x27;t follow through? What makes you think that? It&#x27;s possible that your circumstances and mindset were holding you back.


In fact, our mindset accounts for 80% of our success and mechanics and circumstances account for 20%. Most people know enough to get the job done, but they don&#x27;t because their psychology is out of sync with their objectives.


You can&#x27;t guarantee success, but you can improve your chances. After all, chance favors the prepared. Here I am sharing 6 ways to increase the odds of success.

            >Ask HN: Is there a proper design pattern for this situation?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software&#x27;s API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.
I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I&#x27;m certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I&#x27;d like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.
The problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don&#x27;t see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.
In a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that&#x27;s not an option.
Is my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?

            >:has() Has Landed in Safari</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:
section:has(img) {
  background: lightgray;
}
But eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.
You could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:
form:has(input:invalid) {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
The parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.
It’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():
@supports selector(:has(*)) {
  .info,
  .warning {
    display: none;
  }
}
On a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Replacing a substring of text within a larger string has always been misleading in JavaScript. I wrote Replace All Occurrences of a String in JavaScript years ago and it’s still one of my most read articles. The confusion lies in that replace only replaces the first occurrence of a substring, not all occurrences. For example: […]

This year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time.

What are these CSS files called? Any projects on github or similar with a collection of them I can choose from? I can&#x27;t remember the correct word for these so a web search turns up irrelevant results...

During my nine years in IT, I’ve become acquainted with various domains and participated in the development of large products.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The final four are here! The course on responsive design I wrote for web.dev is now complete, just in time for Christmas. The four new modules are:
Accessibility
User interface patterns
Media features
Screen configurations
These four felt quite “big picture”, and often quite future-facing. I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens. That felt like a fitting way to close out the course, bookending it nicely with the history of responsive design in the introduction.
And with that, the full course is now online. Go forth and learn responsive design!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been playing with OpenStep in a VM lately and it got me wondering what the transition from OpenStep on Intel/Sparc/NeXT hardware to Rhapsody on PPC was like.
Were there builds of basically stock OpenStep 4.2 running on PPC Macs within Apple on the early days? Were there builds with the Rhapsody UI running on Intel only while the rest of the OS was still being ported? Were these both happening at the same time in the same codebase?
I figure someone on here should have some inside information ;)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">That we manage all our programming projects in Basecamp is perhaps an obvious admission since its our own product. But it&#x27;s less obvious to some how that&#x27;s possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can&#x27;t seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn&#x27;t tied together?
The simple answer is: don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That&#x27;…</p>

But the uncomfortable truth is that the web is responsible for a growing proportion of carbon emissions. Rising temperatures, increasingly extreme weather events, and the failure of this year’s COP26 conference to deliver strong leadership have all highlighted the urgency of reducing our emissions if we’re to avoid disastrous climate change. The commitments of world leaders may have fallen short, but we all have a role to play, and we can’t escape our responsibility.

Let’s dig in.
Creating a helper function To get started, let’s create addClass() and removeClass() helper functions.
Each one will accept the elements to add or remove classes from, as well as or more classes to add or remove.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I have just tried to get my access back to my bank account.
Since I switch numbers frequently due to moving countries, 2FA is hell for me.
To get my account back I need a selfie with both my face and ID visible. Very hard. Guess it&#x27;s due to security.
After some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.
Fear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.
Upload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.
The other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.
Am I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer? How do non techies cope?

            >Email is the antidote</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s easy to get down on the internet as a medium for reasoned debate. Every discussion on social media that touch controversial topics seems to descent into the depths of hell in less than sixty seconds. But social media is not the internet. It&#x27;s merely one distorted expression of it. There are other ways to connect, to reason, to learn. Like email!
I don&#x27;t just mean newsletters, though I love them dearly. In fact, I&#x27;d say the majority part part of my media diet now consists of newsletters. Both from the mastodons like The New York Times and Washington Post, but just as importantly from individual journalists and writers, like Matt Levine, Glenn Loury, Bari Weiss, Ben Thompson, Zaid Jilani, Andrew Sullivan, Bob Lefsetz, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Glenn Greenwald.

            >Are we past peak &quot;woke&quot;?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Could John McWhorter have gone on MSNBC or The View or PBS or NPR a year ago to talk about a new book called Woke Racism? Would a book with a title like that even have been welcome at that moment in such chambers? I doubt it.
But now it is. McWhorter has not only written an important book that&#x27;s rightfully garnering broad attention, he&#x27;s also secured an important platform by joining The New York Times as a columnist, and through these outlets, brought an oppositional argument to what five minutes ago were unassailable, widely adopted axioms of antiracism.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We&#x27;re famous for having very few meetings at Basecamp. We generally think meetings are toxic.
Yet, meetings do convey information, and we need to convey information, so what&#x27;s our replacement?
Writing. Long-form, complete-thought, considered writing. We write a lot at Basecamp.
Since long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they&#x27;re ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time. No synchronization of schedules required, no pulling people off their work to sit around a table (or show their face in a box on the screen), and none of the FOMO or stress that&#x27;s tied to real-time communication like group chat.
Long-form writing takes many forms at Basecamp, but &quot;Heartbeats&quot; are a prime example.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">How to create healthy habits that actually stick  


By Katey Chambers


With the new year quickly approaching, you might be starting to think about your health goals, such as losing weight, eating healthier, starting an exercise routine and/or finding ways to manage your stress. And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀


So what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them. Want to know the secret to actually sticking w…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Yesterday, I wrote about some performance problems with nested proxies, and why many state-based UI libraries rely on setter functions instead.
 Unfortunately, Proxies are opaque. There’s no property you can look at or test you can do to determine if an object is already a proxy or not.
And that can lead to situations where you end up with proxies nested inside proxies nested inside proxies nested inside…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">&quot;Real artists ship&quot; was one of Steve Jobs&#x27; mottos. You can clearly see that ethos still in present-day Apple. There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&amp;D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren&#x27;t deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn&#x27;t shipping. And shipping is what counts.
That&#x27;s a hard ethos to live by! It&#x27;s so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it&#x27;s an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.
We&#x27;ve been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we&#x27;d make a promise, which we occasionally couldn&#x27;t keep. It sucks.
But the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It&#x27;s addicting! Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.
Be a real artist. Ship.</p>

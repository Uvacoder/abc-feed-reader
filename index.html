            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">So, you bought a code signing certificate for your Electron app. One step closer to being able to release your app on Windows. Congrats!
Finally, 3 weeks later, after a few phone calls, Sectigo issued the certificate. Woohoo! The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.
In their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).
And then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.
So you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo? Haha nope,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Yesterday, the Microsoft Dev Team announced they’re introducing a proposal to bring TypeScript strict typing natively to the browser.
A lot of devs chimed in with both excitement, and suggestions for other library-based innovations they’d like to see natively. I wanted to unpack that today.
Let’s dig in!
The proposal In their proposal, they suggest something like this…
function equals(x: number, y: number): boolean { return x &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; y; } The team is quick to point that they’re not suggesting live runtime type checking, for both compatibility and performance reasons.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When so much of the American political discourse and agenda is being set and performed on Twitter, it&#x27;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking this forum accurately represents the voice of the people. But not only do the majority of people in the US never tweet, they&#x27;re also increasingly disconnecting from party affiliations. Here&#x27;s a quippy summary from Axios:

Most people you meet in everyday life — at work, in the neighborhood — are decent and normal. Even nice. But hit Twitter or watch the news, and you&#x27;d think we were all nuts and nasty. 75% of people in the U.S. never tweet, Independents would be the biggest party.

These facts are solidly confirmed by media consumption. Joe Rogan&#x27;s independent podcast is vastly more popular than even the most popular weeknight primetime show on the …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Continuing with my JavaScript fun, I wanted to do an updated pass on the horizontal navs I’ve previously built for both GitHub Mobile (prior to the current responsive version and native apps) and this Bootstrap dashboard example.
The goal? Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.
Here’s the final demo via CodePen.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Pre-covid, I was traveling full time to teach ReactJS to corporate clients. My students (mostly developers at banks and insurance companies) would ask me &#x27;What&#x27;s a good React book?&#x27; and I would struggle to recommend something, knowing that all the books sucked or were really out of date. When all my face-to-face training work dried up and I really didn&#x27;t want to do online training, I magically got a contract to write a book.
I started by reading all of the best-selling books on React, and, yeah, they were all really out of date, incomplete, or just wrong.
As I started writing what I hoped would be a really good React book, I also wanted the website to be something useful and a notch above a typical book website. So, I tried to have working examples of the code listings on the site and to organize them in a way that would make them useful for when I started teaching again, or for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to buy a book and just wants to see how things are done.
The book just came out today! The website isn&#x27;t perfect or done, but here it is: https://reactjsfoundations.com .
How&#x27;d I do?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I feel like it’s high time I revived some interest in my proposal for button type&#x3D;&quot;share&quot;. Last I left it, I was gathering use cases and they seem to suggest that the most common use case for the Web Share API is sharing the URL of the current page.
If you want to catch up on the history of this proposal, here’s what I’ve previously written:
A declarative Web Share API
A polyfill for button type&#x3D;”share”
The reason for a share button type
Remember, my proposal isn’t to replace the JavaScript API, it’s to complement it with a declarative option. The declarative option doesn’t need to be as fully featured as the JavaScript API, but it should be able to cover the majority use case. I think this should hold true of most APIs.
A good example is the Constraint Validation API. For the most common …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We recorded an episode for the REWORK podcast yesterday on the essay &quot;Making the Call is Making Progress&quot;, which encourages training those decision-making muscles to be stronger so you can forward quicker. It included a discussion of lowering the price of making decisions by setting yourself up for cheap reversals. If making a bad call isn&#x27;t ruinous, you won&#x27;t be so afraid of making one in the face of incomplete information (upon which all decisions are ultimately made to some degree). What if the same holds true for opinions?
I think one of the reasons my post on being wrong about crypto took off to such an extraordinary degree (the tweet was seen five million times; it was the most read thing ever posted to HEY World) was exactly because it seemed like a very expensive reversal. I had sp…</p>

            >Goodbye, Big Freeda</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:
That time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.
That time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.
That time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.
That time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.
That time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.
That time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.
That time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.
That time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.
That time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.
That time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.
Sweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.
I really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.
Survived the freeze
Texas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov. Greg Abbot — has found out other ways to be shitty by making it illegal to be a caring parent of a trans child. The trauma continues.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I guess that’s obvious. The styles of a site change when a CSS file is updated. An image is replaced when href is changed to point to one file instead of another. So, of course, a font is going to change if, say, the font file is updated. It’s just something that hasn’t crossed, especially […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few years ago, I noticed that a lot of people who are learning JavaScript struggle with putting all of the moving parts together into a working project.
They read tutorials, follow along with other people’s code, and look stuff up on MDN, but when it’s time to sit down and create a project from scratch… nothing! They get stuck. They don’t know how to start.
The Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based workshop I created specifically to address this challenge, and it’s quickly become my most successful learning resource.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi HN,
a while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).
So I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:
* Learning: Classic front/back prompts to memorize things. Think &quot;What is the capital of Argentina?&quot; on the front and &quot;Buenos Aires&quot; on the back. Works with a spaced repetition algorithm so time between prompts is optimized.
* Habits: Recurring actions you want to do - you can set the frequency individually. For example &quot;Stand up and …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m usually not one for coffee appointments or long business lunches, but since the pandemic restrictions were once again nixed a few months ago in Denmark, I&#x27;ve had the calendar packed with exactly such engagements. It&#x27;s been a revelation.
Part of this came as a result of giving an interview to the Danish magazine Computerworld about getting involved in the local startup scene. Some of it from getting on LinkedIn. But just as much came from simply flipping my default from no/later to yes/now when old friends and acquaintances from the industry reached out.
The first revelation was that no matter how introvert you are, spending time face-to-face with others after prolonged periods of isolation is nourishing in a profound and human way (even if it&#x27;s also exhausting). And our family weren&#x27;t …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The other day I noticed a strange thing had happened with the title font on my personal site. Where once the glyphs were clearly defined by glowing outlines, suddenly the outlines were all over the place, bisecting the glyphs in odd ways.
After: Font rendering after the change


  
  Before: How the font should look

My immediate assumption was that it was a browser compatibility issue. After all, I was using the non-standard CSS property text-stroke.
h1 {
  -webkit-text-stroke: 2px var(--accent);
  text-stroke: 2px var(--accent);
}
Although text-stroke is currently well-supported, it comes with a warning that there could be inconsistencies between browser implementations, and behaviour might change in the future. I assumed that Firefox had changed its implementation. But a subsequent chec…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Our next major version, React 18, is available today as a Release Candidate (RC). As we shared at React Conf, React 18 introduces features powered by our new concurrent renderer, with a gradual adoption strategy for existing applications. In this post, we will guide you through the steps for upgrading to React 18.
If you’d like to help us test React 18, follow the steps in this upgrade guide and report any issues you encounter so we can fix them before the stable release.
Note for React Native users: React 18 will ship in React Native with the New React Native Architecture. For more information, see the React Conf keynote here.

Installing
To install the latest React 18 RC, use the @rc tag:
npm install react@rc react-dom@rc

Or if you’re using yarn:
yarn add react@rc react-dom@rc

I don’t want to get notified if a new email arrives (I avoid email on my phone completely) and I certainly don’t want some social media app telling me somebody liked or faved something.
But the number one feature I’d like to see in Safari on iOS is web notifications.
It’s not for me personally, see. It’s because it’s the number one reason why people are choosing not to go all in progressive web apps.
Safari on iOS is the last holdout. But that equates to enough marketshare that many companies feel they can’t treat notifications as a progressive enhancement. While I may not agree with that decision myself, I get it.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s so easy to become addicted to our smartphones, but it doesn’t have to be. If you want to break the cycle of addiction, it’s important that you take control over your smartphone habits. As much as we like our phones, too much time spent on it can lead us into a trap where we are checking emails first thing in the morning and scrolling through Facebook at night or before even getting out of bed. It would be difficult to argue that this is anything but unsuccessful living.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s rare that an argument is so strong that&#x27;ll immediately pierce through all the cognitive defenses an opposing mind might muster. So if you only weigh an argument&#x27;s worth on whether it served to convert someone to your perspective this instant, you&#x27;ll usually be disappointed. &quot;Right now, right here&quot; is a bad timeframe to measure the success of your arguments on. There&#x27;s a long tail of conversion.
Because even when the best arguments fail to breach the mental walls, they often leave cracks. Cracks which time, new observations, and deeper consideration can open. Until the walls finally crumble, and a perspective is let in.
This might happen five minutes after the debate is over, two weeks later, or even a couple of years from now. Some arguments cause cracks that can take a decade or more…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Dave recently wrote some good advice about what to do—and what not to do—when it comes to complaining about web browsers. I wrote something on this topic a little while back:
If there’s something about a web browser that you’re not happy with (or, indeed, if there’s something you’re really happy with), take the time to write it down and publish it
To summarise Dave’s advice, avoid conspiracy theories and snark; stick to specifics instead.
It’s very good advice that I should heed (especially the bit about avoiding snark). In that spirit, I’d like to document what I think is a bug on iOS.
I don’t need to name the specific browser, because there is basically only one browser allowed on iOS. That’s not snark; that’s a statement of fact.
This bug involves navigating from a progressive web app t…</p>

At least in December you get Christmas, whose vibes can even carry you through most of January. But by the time February rolls around, it’s all grim winteriness with no respite in sight.
In the middle of February, Jessica caught the ’rona. On the bright side, this wasn’t the worst timing: if this had happened in December, our Christmas travel plans to visit family would’ve been ruined. On the not-so-bright side, catching a novel coronavirus is no fun.
Still, the vaccines did their job. Jessica felt pretty crap for a couple of days but was on the road to recovery before too long.
Amazingly, I did not catch the ’rona. We slept in separate rooms, but still, we were spending most of our days t…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Marketing makes change happen. And for humans, the change is rarely linear. There’s a moment before and a moment after the decision is made.

I saved this excerpt without reference two years ago, and now I&#x27;m trying to find where it&#x27;s from. It references leading VC&#x27;s in Silicon Valley, so it&#x27;s definitely 2005+.

Maybe I’m affected by me growing up in an an unprecedented part of history, where the entire human knowledge is available through the click of a button. This has a number of key implications.
The first, If you fail, it’s hard to blame anyone but yourself. This is because unless you’re working on something truly unique, which is improbable, someone has worked on it before, and you can learn from that person. It’s true that the unique circumstances of the situation can be specific to you, but in gener…</p>

            >Reframing it</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A friend of mine is pissed off.
He hired someone to replace a bunch of windows at his house.
The guy did the work. Poorly. And now it turns out he needs to have everything redone. Given how badly the job went, he&#x27;s going to work with someone else to get it done right the second time.
What&#x27;s there isn&#x27;t really salvageable. Even the windows themselves need to be reordered.
It&#x27;s a big number, it&#x27;s real money.
He&#x27;s going to try to get some money back from the original guy who messed up the job, but it&#x27;s a long road. Outcomes unknown.
So he&#x27;s staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it.
He asked me if I&#x27;ve ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it.
I absolutely have, and I&#x27;ve always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on.
I told him the way I&#x27;ve approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as &quot;overall, this job cost more than I expected&quot;, rather than &quot;This guy fucked me, I&#x27;m out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it&quot;.
Yes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You&#x27;re a member now.
Loss aversion is of course how it&#x27;s described, but applying technical definitions doesn&#x27;t often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I don’t think I’ve ever read anything from Jeremy Keith that I’ve disagreed with, but this article on CSS-Tricks from back in December really hits hard…
 I’d like to tell you something not to do to make your website better. Don’t add any third-party scripts to your site.
That may sound extreme, but at one time it would’ve been common sense. On today’s modern web it sounds like advice from a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy nut.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the most compelling metaphors of the battle between emotion and reason is that of the elephant and the rider. I first encountered it in Jonathan Haidt&#x27;s book The Righteous Mind. It goes like this:

The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant. The rider is our conscious reasoning—the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes—the ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior.

It&#x27;s the same underlying premise to Julia Galaef&#x27;s book The Scout Mindset. We launder our arguments and reasoning through the tribal wash. Which is made easier by the fact that many valiant principles are in opposition to each other, and that you can often…</p>

If you have been watching the Privacy Sandbox site, you may have noticed changes
to the structure as we introduced the Privacy Sandbox on
Android.
&quot;We’re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on
Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions.
Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data …</p>

Chrome 100 beta was released on March 3, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late March, 2022.
# Last Version for Unreduced User-Agent String
Chromium 100 will be the last version to support an unreduced User-Agent string by default (as well as the related navigator.userAgent, navigator.appVersion, and navigator.platform DOM APIs). The origin trial that allowed sites to test the fully reduced User-Agent will end on April 19, 2022. After that date, the User-Agent String will be gradually reduced. To review the whole schedule, see Chromium Blog: User-Agent Reduction Origin Trial and Dates. Sites that need more time to test or migrate to User-Agent Client Hints can enroll in the deprecation origin…</p>

But everytime I try to get back to using it, I start by (re)installing Feedly, getting furstated by the lack of (what i believe are) key features. Try a bunch of other readers at random, getting fed up, and leave again.
This time, I&#x27;m determined not to let ignorance about good readers stop me.

Imagine an array of objects. Each object has a val property, with a numeric value.
let arr &#x3D; [ {val: 1}, {val: 42}, {val: 24} ];  As a test, Ryan created a function that adds the val property for each item in the array together to get the sum.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">2021 was an incredible year for Ruby on Rails. We started it off still celebrating the third major version of Ruby, and left it with the accomplishment of the seventh major version of Rails. Together, these releases sparked a renewed enthusiasm for building modern web applications with Ruby on Rails, unlike anything I can recall since the late oughts. The moment was finally right, and we were right for the moment.
I spent most of my time last year advancing the new vision of Rails on the frontend with a slew of projects. The biggest lift was getting the dream of a Node-free default Rails approach validated, solidified, and production ready. 
I worked to make that happen by creating importmap-rails, and by taking HEY to this new frontier as a confirmation that we&#x27;d crossed the chasm from vi…</p>

But it should! 30-40% of web pages have a  element and 98% of all canvases use a Canvas2D rendering context.
There are Canvas2Ds in cars, on fridges, and in space (really).
Admittedly, the API is a bit behind the times when it comes to state-of-the-art 2D drawing.
Fortunately we&#x27;ve been hard at work implementing new features in Canvas2D to catch up to CSS, streamline ergonomics and improve performance.
# Part 1: catching up with CSS
CSS has a few drawing commands that are sorely missing from Canvas2D. With the new API we&#x27;ve added a handful of the most requested features:

            >The 15 minute fix vs the 30 day fix</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:
The 15 minute fix
The 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)
I know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…
The 15 minute fix
The fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…
Sometimes the compromise is worth it.…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This is the error message I was greeted with today when launching the LocalWP app: It’s a simple fix, really. The problem (at least to me) is the messaging. Because I have no idea what the heck “Lightning” services are, I found myself looking through preferences, extensions, and more of the app’s nooks and crannies. […]

 Do you use Progressive Enhancement (PE) to build your Web products? If you don’t, do you mind sharing the reason(s) why?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">If your existence is all about work, and work goes to shit, then life goes to shit too. If you live for your hobby, and your hobby hits the wall, then your life crashes too. If everything else is waiting until you hang with your mates, and your mates fade away, then you fade too. Betting your drive to get up in the morning on a single path will leave you completely stuck if that one road is blocked.
Don&#x27;t bet all your happiness and purpose on a single square. 
It&#x27;s fine to lean on one pillar or another at different times in your life, but you&#x27;d do well to make sure there&#x27;s a few others holding up the roof if the first one crumbles. Yes, rock it out at work, but reserve some evenings and weekends for a hobby too. Sure, enjoy that tight-knit crew, but realize that life eventually changes for them some day as well.
Diversification is resilience in action. It&#x27;s having something in reserve. It&#x27;s knowing that everyone, everywhere, doing anything, will eventually suffer setbacks, frustration, and despair. And planning for that by packing a bag with more than just hammers.
It doesn&#x27;t have to be 33/33/33, but you aren&#x27;t prepared for the likely life if it&#x27;s 90/5/5. And it won&#x27;t help you that one in a hundred can hit glory for a while betting it all on 100/0/0. You&#x27;ll only ever see their highlight reel, and you&#x27;ll never see the other ninety-nine who crashed and burned.
Diversify your life.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">During my recovery I’ve made it a point to double down on improving my rather limited JavaScript skills. Courses have been helpful, but it seems that no matter the course, I do my best learning by making things myself. So I’ve been tinkering around and trying to build some new projects.
My latest experiment was to build something that allows me to toggle a class on an element with a particular id.


  Toggle



  This element will have the .blue class toggled on it.



The gist is that I want to use a  to toggle any class I want on another element of my choosing, all using data attributes so that it’s infinitely flexible and functional in any context.

The MOOCs are called:

Previously they were called Systematic Program Design 1, 2, ..
How are the courses in comparison to the actual book?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.
Born in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.
With the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.

ふるさとの街やかれ
身よりの骨うめし焼土に
今は白い花咲く
ああ許すまじ原爆を    
三度許すまじ原爆を    
われらの街に

ふるさとの海荒れて
黒き雨喜びの日はなく
今は舟に人もなし
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの海に

ふるさとの空重く
黒き雲今日も大地おおい
今は空に陽もささず
ああ許すまじ原爆を
三度許すまじ原爆を
われらの空に

はらからのたえまなき
労働にきずきあぐ富と幸
今はすべてついえ去らん

The city of my hometown
We buried the charred bones of our relatives
White flowers are blooming now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our city

The sea of my hometown is rough
There is no day of joy in black rain
There are no people in the boats now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sea

The sky of my hometown
Black clouds, the earth is covered today
Now the sun isn&#x27;t in the sky
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
In our sky

No praise from the belly
Wealth and happiness is labor
I can&#x27;t leave everything now
Oh forgive the nuclear bomb
Forgive the nuclear bomb three times
On top of the world</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">LONDON, 1st March 2022 – AG Grid, the industry-leading provider of JavaScript datagrids, rolled out version 27 (AG Grid 27) this month, which introduces major improvements in developer productivity, functionality and accessibility.
One of the most noteworthy new features for AG Grid 27, is that its 100% React Rendering Engine is now the default engine for AG Grid React. This means AG Grid React is no longer a thin React wrapper over a JavaScript library. The new rendering engine means AG Grid works perfectly within the React Developer Tools ecosystem for viewing component state, managing render cycles, profiling and improving performance of the app.
The pure React Rendering Engine for AG Grid has been in development for almost a year, and creating it required the development team to refact…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">2022 is shaping up to be a pretty great year for CSS, with a plethora of new features on the horizon. Some are already starting to land in browsers, others are likely to gain widespread browser support in 2022, while for one or two the process may be a little longer. In this article we’ll take a look at a few of them.</p>

Encouragement means that someone sees us, understands us and believes in us. Even (especially) when things don’t turn out as we hoped. Encouragement lasts. Encouragement is self-fueling and self-fulfilling.</p>

            >Are My Third Parties Green?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.

Recently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).
Often we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)
One thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.
Tools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
The count down to version 100 of Chrome and Firefox is just
weeks away.
CSS cascade layers gives you more control over your CSS, and
helps to prevent style-specificity conflicts.
The showPicker() method allows you to programmatically
show a browser picker for  elements like date, color, and
datalist.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 99.
# Chrome 100 and Firefox 100
Chrome 100 ships in late March (2022), and Firefox 100 ships shortly after in
early May. Both of these are a major version number milestone and roll over
to three digits. But, if your code is expecting two digits, the new version
number could cause issues for you.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">How often do you take deep breaths during exercise? If you do not, you might be missing out on some benefits. This article will show you three techniques to help you breathe deeper while working out.


Deep breathing has been shown to increase oxygen levels in the blood, improve cardiovascular health, and even boost mood. The problem is that most people are not aware of breathing correctly during exercise.


You should inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps prevent air from entering your lungs and causing them to collapse. You also open your chest and expand your ribcage when you breathe deeply. It is a great way to stretch the muscles of your upper back.


When you breathe more deeply, you get more oxygen into your body. That means you are getting more energy d…</p>

            >Τ’ακορντεόν</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”
Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.
I first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.


Στη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο
που ήξερε και έπαιζε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν
όταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος
φωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Μα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ&#x27; άλλα
κράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν
φασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα
και μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Τ&#x27; αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει
όποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν
κι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει
δε θα περάσει ο φασισμός


In my old neighborhood I had a friend
who knew and played the accordion
when he sang, he was like the sun
fires in his hands ignited by the accordion

But at one dark night, like every other night
he kept a look-out playing the accordion
fascist trucks stood in the paddock
and a gun shot stopped the accordion

The started slogan comes back to me
whenever I hear an accordion
and it has marked my life like a stamp
&#x27;Fascism will not prevail!&#x27;</p>

            >Show HN: Hibiki HTML – New License and Bulma UI Controls</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!
The biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now
licensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI
approved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,
commercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.
I&#x27;ve also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -
https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,
tabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a
simple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There
are also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code
highlighting.
Hibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on
JS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,
reuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.
No tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,
no build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.
It works works great for embedding into backend
servers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or
adding dynamic functionality to static sites.
I&#x27;d love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.
If you have a project you&#x27;d like to use Hibiki HTML on, I&#x27;m also happy
to lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you
might need.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When counting text characters in HTML strings, you usually do not want to include the characters in the HTML markup code. While parsing HTML with RegExp does have its limits, in this case, RegExp works very well.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I went on Jason Calacanis&#x27; podcast this week for the fourth time. We&#x27;ve had some explosive, illuminating, and contested conversations over the years, Jason and I. And I&#x27;ve loved everyone of them. Whether we were discussing venture capital, profitable businesses, and the definition of success or talking about big tech, education, healthcare, and wealth taxes. Having intense debates about big questions is a thrill. But this last one was different.
Partly because we simply agreed more than we usually do, but also because the topics felt dangerous this time around. Like I ought to weigh my words carefully, lest I open a flank for later attacks. Like every argument ought to be hidden in an armored helmet from inside a protective trench.
In all my appearances on Jason&#x27;s show over the past decade…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The easy problems are often an illusion. If they were real and they were easy, they’d be solved already. Difficult problems, on the other hand, stick around until someone with insight, dedication and commitment shows up and gets to work. Seeking out difficult problems is far more effective than avoiding them.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Throughout history, across the world, humans have shared their culture with others through song. Songs from their faith, country, region, race, culture, subculture, futbol team, or even the local tavern; a shared connection. The following is one of the songs from my community, a lament, I’d like to share with you all.
Been In This War For Too Long: Liturgical Demonstrations From Bygone Days by Seth Woods

G             D           C  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
G                 D  
We’ve got so much hurt  
Remember we’ve fallen so hard  
From our concrete towers to Earth  
Remember we sleep every night  
With doors locked and shades pulled down tight  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  

G             C       G  
We’re already so terrified  
Em                  C  
We just stay in one place  
We just cover our faces  
We just look at our hands  
Em                      C       D  
We just don’t know what time it is  

Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Just could you please be kind  
We’re grateful for so many things  
But you also gave us these minds  
Like you gave us the sky and the trees  
And we couldn’t keep them from harm  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
We’ve wired our hearts with alarm  

We just sit in these chairs now  
We just stare at these screens now  
We just work all the time now  
We just don’t know what day it is  

We’re tired and hungry for dreams now  
We’ve traded our love for relief  
When our casualties rise like black rivers  
From deserts to flood city streets  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Please don’t deny us our song  
We’re rambling, restless, and weary  
We’ve been in this war for too long  
We’re black and we’re blue and we’re broke down  
We’ve been in this war for too long

            >Interview with a senior JavaScript developer in 2022</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Everything is terrible right now. If you need a break, this satirical interview with a JS developer in 2022 is one of the most painfully accurate and funny things I’ve seen in a while.
 Some of my favorite quotes…
 “Yea, we use React! Well, we actually use Preact. We actually use Svelte. We actually went back to vanilla JavaScript…” “At least you know it’s bad…” “jQuery? What are you, 5?</p>

            >The advantages of large, long-running pull requests</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My favorite part of doing code reviews is to see all the trade-offs, design decisions, and changes in context together. You can&#x27;t easily do that if your feature has been chopped into itty bitty pieces as independent pull requests under pressure never to let them run longer than a week. So at Basecamp, we let pull requests run as long as they need to encompass a complete feature or fix. That&#x27;s everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow Shape Up).
This approach isn&#x27;t entirely without trade-offs. The longer your pull request is running off the main branch, the greater the chance that you&#x27;ll have merge conflicts. But you can mitigate much of this by ensuring you keep your pull request up to date with main by frequently merging main into the pull request. I can appreciate…</p>

Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to migrate away from using the reduced User-Agent string and move toward User-Agent Client Hints can take part in a deprecation trial to continue receiving the full User-Agent string.
The registration for the deprecation trial will begin with the Chrome 100 Beta. It will allow sites to receive the full User-Agent string ahead of the Chrome 101 release, where the minor version string will be reduced. If you would like to test the origin trial on Chrome 100 Beta before it launches to the stable channel, be sure to register and test before the release date for Chrome 100 (currently scheduled for March 31st, 2022).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The first speakers are live on the UX London 2022 site! There are only five people announced for now—just enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. There will be many, many more.
Putting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.
I’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…
The first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.
The second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By far the most furiously pushback I&#x27;ve received for writing about the Canadian trucker protest has come from calling it &quot;peaceful&quot;. Objections to this term has taken many forms. But they all seek to justify the opposite label of &quot;violent&quot;, no matter the blind logical leaps required.
Some claim that the background of certain organizers or participants as either anti-government, white supremacist, trumpers, conferate-flag-wavers, or whatever means that even if there were no (or only isolated) violent acts, that this still rendered the protests at large violent. Others that &quot;hateful rhetoric&quot; or &quot;unacceptable views&quot; was violence in speech. Others still that incessant honking or blocked streets constituted violence against the peace and habitability of their city.

Let’s dig in!
A quick summary The sites and apps I build are absurdly fast. They load nearly instantly.
Even on spotty 3G connections on the other side of the world, where many of my students live, things still load really quickly (like, 3 seconds or less fast).</p>

            >How to land the job you really want</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">As someone who&#x27;s been hiring people for 23 years, I&#x27;ve seen, read, and reviewed tens of thousands of job applications.
The ones that typically rise to the top are the ones that demonstrate effort to get this job, and not just any job.
We recently hired our first Email Marketing Manager. Nearly 400 people applied for the position.
As applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.
I wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant&#x27;s permission, although it&#x27;s been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren&#x27;t comfortable sharing publicly.
Beyond it being an exceptionally good application — you&#x27;ll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job. This is who we hired. It&#x27;s a great example of what really wanting the job can look like when you put in the extra effort to stand out in the right ways.

            >Why Self-Care Can Assist You in Stress Management</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Many of us have so many duties in life that we neglect to look after our own needs. This is especially true for those who are responsible for a large number of people. Self-care is a vital element of stress management, even if it&#x27;s difficult to prioritize when you have so many other things on your to-do list.


How Self-Care Can Help You


When we&#x27;re physically and emotionally exhausted, we&#x27;re less equipped to handle the challenges that life throws at us. Or, to put it another way, when we are physically and emotionally at our best, we are more robust and capable of handling life&#x27;s stress. A massage, a hot bath, or some other type of pampering rejuvenates you on the inside and out. Taking time to maintain self-care provides a number of advantages.

            >Show HN: Wachy – A UI for eBPF-based performance debugging</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I never did make it all the way through Jean Baudrillard&#x27;s book Simulacra and Simulation before I lost my paperback copy on a trip. But it lodged several perspectives deep in my brain that I&#x27;m still trying to process. One of which was this:

Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real.

It&#x27;s a novel illustration of the point both David Graeber and Yuval Noah Harari have kept making in their works: Human institutions are all, broadly speaking, make believe. 
Where Harari illustrates this point with everything from the corporation to human rights, Graeber invites us to imagine fresh alternatives to debt and capitalism. And I remember nodding to both, but it was Baudrillard&#x27;s pithy contrast that really made the point sink in.
Yet even when it&#x27;s sunk …</p>

I’m very happy to lose this bet.
When I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web. While that pessimism was misplaced in this case, it was informed by data.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Someone in a Slack group I’m a member of shared recently shared a link to a post by Cory Doctorow titled The Memex Method. In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:
The very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.
That’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.

This year marks fifteen years of freelancing in my life. That’s 100% of my work life and nearly half the time I live on this world. So I wrote something down on it on my blog. WDRL itself will turn 10 next year already which amazes me when I think about it. I want to say thank you to all who subscribe to my newsletter, who support me with recommendations to others, with money contributions or other things. You’re keeping this project alive and make it a usually joyful thing to send out a new edition.
To close the intro and dive into the articles, I want to share this mini documentary about my work-life in which I share how I combine web development and market gardening today as well as how to protect yourself from burn-out situations:

There&#x27;s just so much to oppose: Bitcoin&#x27;s grotesque energy consumption, the ridiculous transaction fees and low throughput, the incessant pump&#x27;n&#x27;dump schemes in shitcoins, the wild price swings in the main coins, the obvious fraud that is Tether, the lack of real decentralization in most of the current web3 infrastructure, and on, and on, and on.
Beyond all these very real problems and challenges, my bigger beef was actually fueled by a lack of imagination. I could see the fundamental promise of a digital currency free of banks if you were living in a…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.
Web Performance And The Planet
Fershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.

Building a Greener Web
My own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.

The Carbon Footprint of Images
Jon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.

You might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!</p>

            >Making a custom clear text field button</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When people add custom clear buttons to their text fields they generally do one of three things: They do not make them accessible at all. They unnecessarily add them to the keyboard focus order of the web page. They ensure the clear buttons are accessible - but not keyboard focusable. The clear button(s) do not show up when their associated fields are readonly or disabled, The button’s respect reading directionality of a web page (e.g., dir&#x3D;rtl), and that keyboard focus returns to the text field once the clear button has been activated.</p>

So-called UX is a scourge.
My experience in industry has been (unsurprisingly) that companies care only for usability insofar as marketability (or lawsuits) are concerned (so looms the shadow of the American Federation for the Blind).
I spent the better part of a year working out how to make a Swing desktop app usable for the blind (not to mention a full prior year of HCI graduate-level training and consultation with a blind PhD. candidate for the same) into something tolerable by prevailing standards, for which I insisted on actual trials by blind users.
Today, I feel like we need an American Federation for the Sighted (or otherwise perceiving) to

However, it’s important to look at emerging content formats that try to encompass modern needs. In this article, Knut shares his advice against Markdown by looking back on why it was introduced in the first place, and by going through some of the major developments of content on the web.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This is a reply to my own blog post: Building an Automated Screenshot Service on Netlify in ~140 Lines of Code.
There is a limitation with the Screenshot Service: when the page you’re taking a screenshot of is slow and/or very large, the request times out. Quoth myself, from ~7 months ago:
What happens if a site is super slow or is currently down?
Netlify Functions have a 10 second execution limit. If the site doesn’t render in 10 seconds, we show a fallback image by default. Currently this is a low-contrast 11ty logo using the same image size as the requested screenshot (via SVG width and height attributes).
While this fallback behavior is okay I was starting to see it more often than I’d like. Why, you might ask? Why would it take more than 10 seconds to fetch a screenshot?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi all, author here.
This project was a pleasure to do, Remix has very good developer experience. But further than that it&#x27;s actually a really good way to develop applications, it&#x27;s a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).
And it turns out that it&#x27;s actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it&#x27;s intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!
You can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.
By the way I&#x27;m currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)

This past month, WebPageTest got a redesigned and reorganized UI. WebPageTest has always been right at home with power users, but with more folks than ever paying attention to performance today, it’s critical that we make WebPageTest easier for everyone.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the biggest missing features from most static site generators (like Hugo, 11ty, and Jekyll, ) is that they lack built-in search.
Database-driven platforms like WordPress make a server call and search the database to find matching content. Static websites have no database to query.
Today, I’m going to share how I built the search functionality for my site with vanilla JS. Let’s dig in!
Quick aside: done-for-you alternative If you don’t want to roll-your-own search functionality, Algolia and ElasticSearch are two done-for-you search vendors.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">What&#x27;s the goodwill of developers worth to a platform operator? It&#x27;s a hard question, because it can&#x27;t be answered by the traditional economic models used by bean counters to populate the balance sheet. And it&#x27;s far more ephemeral than the goodwill of consumers. The relationship is more intertwined. We&#x27;re not just engaging in transactions, we&#x27;re lifting each other up. Good developers breed strong platforms, and strong platforms attract good developers. When it works, it&#x27;s symbiotic.
There&#x27;s nothing symbiotic about Apple&#x27;s current relationship with its developers. 
Every time Apple mobilizes its law machine to squash a developer in court, foil democratic accountability in the legislatures, or give regulators the middle finger, Apple wounds the relationship with developers. They can win ever…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I suck at CSS. There, I said it.
I&#x27;ve always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let&#x27;s me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.
I understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don&#x27;t.
I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I&#x27;ve gather after a few days, I don&#x27;t understand it.
Instead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don&#x27;t want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.
Ok, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn&#x27;t that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?
I must be missing something, right?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Way back when, we used to release new software on Fridays all the time. That often meant working Saturdays and Sundays to fix an urgent problem with the new stuff, wrecking the weekend for whoever did the release.
It was stupid yet predictable, because we kept setting deadlines at the end of the week, as most naturally do. But Friday is the worse day to release anything.
First off, you probably rushed to finish before the weekend. So work done on Fridays tends to be a bit sloppy.
Second, Mondays don&#x27;t come after Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays do. So if something goes wrong, someone&#x27;s working the weekend.
Third, if you work the weekends, you don&#x27;t get a chance to recharge. Basically, when you&#x27;ve worked all week, and you&#x27;re forced to work the weekend, the following Monday is the eighth day o…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.
She did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it&#x27;s just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I&#x27;m 100% biased): https://kevin.tw
Fun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn&#x27;t have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).

            >Most Popular Wireframe tools Small Business Should Consider in 2022</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Wireframing is the first and the most crucial step in deciding the fate of an application. The right wireframe can make an excellent app – turning an idea perfectly into an app, while a wrong wireframe can break everything. And to make a wireframe perfect, you need a wireframing tool to solve your design purpose.  […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m slowly regaining my faith in debates again. You know, the ancient practice of listening, presenting arguments, accepting counterarguments, and progressing towards a deeper shared understanding. Even when the topics are hot. Even when the counterpart is a stranger. And it&#x27;s giving me vintage internet vibes!
Take this Canadian trucker protest, for example. I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of Canadians on the topic. Some support the protests, others don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s clearly a topic where a Canadian might feel like a Dane shouldn&#x27;t have standing to participate in the discussion (and plenty do!). Yet literally all the many debates I&#x27;ve had over the past week since writing about this topic have managed to be civil and respectful despite also occasionally being tense. Remarkable.

I was driving along a country back road ‘out bush’, when I noticed the Department of Parks and Wildlife trucks making a roadblock.  


A tunnel of thick black smoke filled the hot summer air just beyond them, billowing and undulating aggressively as if it was sent by the Devil himself to annihilate all life on Earth.


I stopped at the roadblock, mesmerized by the ferocity of nature, when I saw the weird thing…


Men and women, wearing fluorescent yellow onesies were deliberately setting fire to the bushland. 


Deliberately!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today, we’re going to talk about a tried-and-true performance recommendation that’s not so tried or true anymore: CDN caching.
Let’s dig in!
The old best-practice around CDNs For years, one of the big performance recommendations with large JavaScript and CSS libraries was to host it from a shared CDN.
Take jQuery, for example. The idea was simple: someone visits catsarethebest.com, where they’re loading jquery.1.1.8.js from the jQuery CDN. Then, that same person visits dogsarebetter.</p>

If you&#x27;re seeing this video, it is Monday, February 14—Yep.
Which means that I am now very excited to announce that effective today, Netlify will be sponsoring full-time development of Eleventy!
Eleventy started with the very basic idea that the tools we use to make websites should be simpler for both beginners and experts, and we are still working very hard to continue to deliver on that mission today.
This announcement is such huge news for our project in multiple ways: the project&#x27;s longevity, sustainability, delivery of features, integrations fixes enabling folks to take on even larger scale projects (if this sounds like your project, please get in touch).
This is one small part of Netlify&#x27;s larger strategy to invest in an ecosystem of frameworks and tools to make building for the web easier, more resilient, and more scalable. I&#x27;m now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.
And personally speaking, I&#x27;m just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.
I&#x27;m grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn&#x27;t a prerequisite.
And I don&#x27;t know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we&#x27;re going to find out what it really feels like to run.
Stay tuned.</p>

            >Implementing A Svelte Store In Rust</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We’re going to build a Svelte store, written in Rust, and run it in an Electron app.
This spun out of a video editor which I originally built in Swift. It turns out people on Windows want to edit videos too, so now I’m rewriting it with Rust, Electron, and Svelte with an eye for performance.
Rust is a systems programming language, akin to C or C++, but safer. It’s known for being super fast.
Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty. But there’s an ace up its sleeve: Electron apps can be extended with compiled native code, and if you do the heavy stuff in native code you can a nice speed boost.
Svelte is a JavaScript UI framework – an alternative to React, Vue, Angular, or one of the other 750…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It might be unusual for a web developer, but up until recently I’d never had an ad blocker installed. I use Firefox as my main browser, which claims to protect privacy by blocking trackers. And to be honest, I don’t read a lot of articles on desktop, preferring to read the news on mobile while I’m on the go. While you might get one or two pop-ups on mobile, the area available for them is clearly a lot smaller, and I generally find the browsing experience for many of the sites I regularly visit is OK.
Most of the sites I do visit on desktop are for my day-to-day job, or research for this blog, and are built with developers as the target audience. I haven’t noticed any/many annoying popups or slow-loading pages on these sites, probably because I know which sites can be trusted to provide qua…</p>

            >How do you create a custom element?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Custom elements are part of the Web Components standard. They allow you to extend the browser&#x27;s native HTML elements or create new ones. When used well, this makes them portable and reusable in any later projects without worrying about backward compatibility or framework choices.</p>

The rest of the site is unfinished, so any shitty UI/UX quirks WILL be fixed. I just wanted to show this off and get some general feedback.

EVERY Gundam Timeline Explained - Tim Lyu breaks down every Gundam timeline and series in an incredible and obsessive fashion. I also watched his Evangelion breakdown too. youtube.com
Scams, Art Theft and NFTs - I like Brad Colbow’s thinking, from an artist’s perspective, around NFTs. youtube.com
Make Free Stuff - Max Böck touches on one of my biggest concerns with Web3 in that it attempts “to impose even more artificial locks and transactions on users, to extract even more money”, getting away from the Web’s anti-capitalist beginnings. mxb.dev
Omnichord - Jake Albaugh makes a free musical instrument using the Web Audio API. And it’s fun. Also, subdomains rule. omnichord.jake.fun
nuxt-cms-template - Alex Riviere and Andrew Walpole figured out how to integrate Netlify CMS’s block-based editor and preview feature with a Nuxt application. It may not sound like a big deal but getting a React app and a Nuxt app working together without creating a turducken is pretty intuitive. github.com

 The decision, by Landgericht München’s third civil chamber in Munich, found that the website, by including Google-Fonts-hosted font on its pages, passed the unidentified plaintiff’s IP address to Google without authorization and without a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This installment of *Web Design Done Well* celebrates weird and wacky websites. Sites with sweet, innocent, sometimes pointless purposes.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s an exciting time in web development. After a decade&#x27;s worth of front-end progress kept demanding ever more complicated setups, we&#x27;re finally moving in the opposite direction. With simpler tools that are still able to hit those high-fidelity user interface notes, but at a sliver of the cost in complexity. The long expansion of enabling concepts is now at last being compressed for human comprehension. Hallelujah!
And like with expanding complexity, where one complication often leads to another, compressing complexity also cascades.
Propshaft, a new asset pipeline library for Rails, is the result of such a cascading compression of complexity. Enabled by the same trifecta of HTTP/2, browser-run ES6, and import maps that powers Rails 7, Propshaft is dramatically simpler than the Sprockets …</p>

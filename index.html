Does anyone remember what this was? Or have examples of websites that are similar?

          <p>Signed exchanges (SXGs) are a means to improve your page speed—mainly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). When referring sites (currently Google Search) link to a page, they can prefetch it into the browser cache before the user clicks on the link.
It&#x27;s possible to make web pages that, when prefetched, require no network on the critical path to rendering the page! On a 4G connection, this page load goes from 6s to 0.9s (the remaining 0.9s being mostly by CPU usage):
          

Most people publishing SXGs today are using Cloudflare&#x27;s easy-to-use Automatic Signed Exchanges (ASX) feature (though open source options exist too):
In many cases, checking the box to enable this feature is enough to get the kind of substantial improvement shown above. Sometimes, there are a few more steps to ensure th…</p>

          <p>This was a talk given at the Eleventy Meetup (11tymeetup.dev). While it was originally titled a “State of 11ty” talk, it somehow got laser-focused on differentiating between the Eleventy rendering modes: Build, Serverless, and Edge.
Video pending. I’ll link up the video here when it’s added to the Eleventy Meetup YouTube channel.

          <p>There exists a lot of high-quality UI component libraries such as MUI, Bootstrap, ANT, Grommet, Chakra, Semantic UI, etc. These components typically map to primitive types:
    boolean -&gt; checkbox / toggle button / visibility
    integer -&gt; numeric input / slider
    enum -&gt; drop down menu / radio buttons
    string -&gt; text field
    date -&gt; date picker
    array -&gt; list view
    matrix -&gt; table view
    bitmap -&gt; image
    async promise -&gt; loading indicator
    side effect -&gt; button

Have I been searching in the wrong place or do such higher-level UI component libraries actually don&#x27;t exist?

Because of the CRT screen and the vector graphics, the in-person experience was unique and difficult to replicate.  Likewise, the very simple button and rotating knob interface combination was approachable but presented unique challenges in the gameplay.

          <p>The surprisingly rapid pace of innovation in the blockchain space has become quite obvious to even the staunchest of crypto critics. The successful deployment of Ethereum scalability solutions, such as Polygon, has substantially accelerated the adoption curve for blockchain and Web3 apps. Gaming, FinTech, digital identity, social media and publishing will very likely become Web3-enabled within the next 5 to 10 years. DeFi(decentralized finance) apps and platforms are already there, offering a solution to several problems in traditional finance.
There&#x27;s an ever-increasing demand for experienced UI/UX designers among forward-looking Web3 startups. 
But for a new technology to succeed and achieve mass adoption, it doesn’t only need to improve upon the existing status quo — it also has to avoi…</p>

          <p>I use Thunderbird. I have configured it so that it shows me the text part of the emails I get.
Unfortunately, every now and then the text part is so broken that I would like to render the HTML part.
But it seems like Thunderbird does not offer a way to do this for a single email.
Looking at the source code of such an email, there is no plain HTML but some gibberish with &quot;Content-Type: multipart/alternative;&quot; or &quot;Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable&quot;.
Any ideas how to go about this?

          <p>Developers often tell us that it’s difficult to keep up with changes on the web and understand why these changes are happening. Today, we’re kicking off a new series called Chrome Dev Insider where we’ll share (1) What’s cool and newsworthy, (2) An insight into how we made a decision on a key topic (for example changing FLOC) or approach our work with the ecosystem (for example Interop 2022), and (3) any really important things that you need to know about (for example changes in user agent strings).
As we share what we are working on, it will be in the context of our four priorities for 2022:
Enabling delightful user experiences: make things intuitive for users; whether it’s performance, transactions, identity or transitions.
Advancing the web’s capabilities: support the web&#x27;s evolving rol…</p>

          <p>Embedded content is the best way to keep users on your site, while sharing
content from other pages or sites. This could be as small as an embedded Tweet,
which displays in Twitter&#x27;s style and format. It could be as large as an
entirely separate site embedded onto your own, such as an embedded Shopify shop
where visitors can make a purchase without leaving your site.
Now more than ever, it&#x27;s important that our sites remain secure when we embed
content.
There are several ways developers can embed content on a website. The most
common technique is to use an
,
which allows you to embed any content onto your site with just a URL. It&#x27;s
already possible to add the sandbox attribute to make an iframe more secure.
Alternatively, you could use a proposed HTML element:

          <p>We’ve all seen websites or digital experiences that we immediately thought of as “bad designs.” But what actually makes a design “bad”? And how do we, as designers, learn to recognize and avoid those mistakes?
Understanding what makes a design bad is the first step in learning how to create good designs. Here are ten common examples of bad design and how to correct their shortcomings.
1. The design is too cluttered
Cluttered designs were commonly seen in the early days of the internet. Designers tried to cram as much as they could onto each page, often ignoring white space entirely. The results were pages that were hard to navigate, lacked structure, and made finding what you were looking for almost impossible.
While the cluttered UIs of 90s design and early 00s have (mostly) disappeared, …</p>

          <p>Im currently exploring the design of an account and role based permissions system.
Im trying to look for and find standard patterns (if any) for structuring user accounts, organisations, sub organisations and products.
It would need to handle:
1. Role based permissions
2. Roll up billing
My initial thoughts are:
1. A user account is unique but can be a member of 1 or more organisations.
2. An organisation could have one or more sub organisations. 
3. An organisation (or sub organisation) would be subscribed to one or more products
4. A the product level, the user would have role based permissions to provide access to certain features.
How would you best design something like this from a rule / hierarchy perspective?
Would you apply role based permissions at every level for the user?

          <p>Hello, i am a part time/student worker as Frontend Developer. Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.
I saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.
My experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?
I can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular. Am i alone?

Alternatively if any of you are happy to share screenshots of your custom UI designs I would love to see them!

          <p>I sometimes spot colleagues making design decisions that seem really bad to me. A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like &quot;how does this compare to open source library X&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I&#x27;m not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m looking to level-up my API design game and thought a solid book on the topic could be great, but I&#x27;m having a hard time picking out signal from noise in the sea of publications. Especially considering some recommendations out there are a decade+ old, when things have changed significantly in certain areas (like browser tech) since then.
Primarily thinking about web APIs (meaning REST these days) but anything goes. Guiding principles &gt;&gt; &quot;how to build an API in framework Foo&quot;!
Have you got any suggestions? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HN!
While working on a project that requires some images of keyboard shortcuts to be put in documentation, I came up with the idea of this small design tool.
kcaps.app is quite simple, however, it provides a number of color schemes and allows users to quickly print or press keyboard combinations and download images as a result.
I hope it will be helpful for someone else :)

          <p>Hey,
if you read this email, it’ll be technically different from the previous. When I recently updated my newsletter service server software nearly everything broke into pieces. I was using mailtrain v1 for a long time now but it’s deprecated and using old node versions. Upgrading to v2 wasn’t easy enough for me and I also wanted to have an easier to maintain mailer anyway. The new email is sent via Spatie’s Laravel Mailcoach. So far it’s a pretty manual process again since it doesn’t support RSS-campaigns. At some point in future I want to publish the newsletter via Kirby to the Mailcoach API.
But at this point I now changed my template as well to a modern MJML based template code. This should hopefully fix all the rendering issues you reported to me recently. I tried to support light and…</p>

          <p>It can be super fun to work with teams on unique and exciting products, but the real success of virtually any product begins and ends with the user. It’s as simple as this: no users, no product.
This begs the question, how can you create great products for your users?
When you incorporate great UX design principles into your product, your users will have a better experience. Great UX starts with great user research.
Excellent user research can help your team with scheduling and technical feasibility. It can also provide much-needed insights into your users with cross-functional applications (think of your marketing department).

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30928671 target="_blank">Ask HN: How does Apple do UX research?</a>
          <p>It seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma in releasing products &quot;MVP, agile, user-centered design, user studies, etc&quot;.
Yet if these principles are being followed, why does the industry keep pumping low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?
Apple&#x27;s secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.
What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?
Some &quot;more verifiable&quot; sources:

Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.

          <p>Hi all,
My name is Simone Di Nuovo and i&#x27;m the creator of tilepieces, an open source project to visually editing HTML documents and Web applications.
Tilepieces is a software that allows you to create applications for editing HTML documents, using some of the popular interfaces of the browser developer tools (with which it is possible to integrate css edits).
Tilepieces also allows you to reuse your favorite code and libraries, and exposes APIs that are useful for editing multiple files at a time.
You can start using tilepieces with its progressive web application version at https://pwa.tilepieces.net!
I will be happy to receive any comments from you.

          <p>Screenshot from a Codepen demo. Hovering on a grid item expands the grid tracks.

Somehow it’s already three months since I wrote about the CSS :has() pseudo-class landing in Safari Technology preview. The latest Safari (proper) release has just shipped with support, and can be enabled with a flag in the next Chrome release.
Meanwhile, I’ve been playing around with some ideas on how we can use :has() for styling a gallery or product grid layout. One of the cool things about the selector is that it allows us to not only style a parent element based on any one of its children, but to also style that child’s siblings too. So, building a menu, we could apply some styles to other elements in the menu when one of the links is hovered:
/* Style the list border when link is hovered */

          <p>I booked myself a week off work in late Feb and leading up to that date I started to get (back) into Gameboys. As a kid I grew up with a ZX Spectrum in the home and as a teen I had a Gameboy. I actually managed to use paper-round money to buy myself a pretty nice collection of games, but then for some reason sold it all off - only to then want to re-buy a Gameboy. I wasn&#x27;t so business savvy at that point.
Early on in the year I found that refurbishing Gameboys and modding them wasn&#x27;t too tricky for my own skills and as Feb started to come around two lots on Ebay piqued my interest: one with 8 Gameboys and another with 14. Of the 14, none worked (according to the seller) and of the 8, one worked (a Gameboy Advanced).
After much stress of bidding, I managed to secure the lots, plus purchased…</p>

          <p>One day I came across this video about Muharrem, a deaf man, and how his whole neighborhood conspired against him for a surprise.

Here I am, crying at my desk, moved to tears by an advertisement for a Samsung product in Turkey. You watch as Muharrem’s expression moves from confused, to disbelief, to overwhelm. Muharrem tears up, I tear up. Imagine what it must feel like to leave your house and the mismatch you feel every day got erased; the world works for you in a way that it didn’t before.
What if…

          <p>Corporate networks have lots of resources around good practice: partitioning, zero trust, vlans etc. But home  networks seem to me to be a giant attack surfaces, and incredibly juicy targets.
What constitutes modern best practice for the design and implementation of secure, performant home networks? Im thinking there must be more than NAT, tossing Alexa in the garbage and crossed fingers.

          <p>Next.js’ recent 12.0 release included a new beta feature: middleware.

          <p>There’s a bit of a setup to this song: Big Bird is pouting in his nest, jealous of the new baby Cody which gets a lot of attention. The whole street is concerned about Big Bird. If you ask me, Big Bird is being a bit of a bitch about it all but clearly he’s going through some strong feelings. The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie1 comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.
“Different people, different ways” has been a useful parenting tool. It helps us resolve unfairness in moments of sibling rivalry, but also helps in explaining differences of the human condition. Why do they use a wheelchair? Why are they short? Why do they talk lik…</p>

It’s certainly an exciting time to be working on the web right now, with browser support for new features moving along at lightning-fast pace! This month saw Safari drop a new release that includes support for a tonne of new stuff, including :has() (A.K.A. the “parent selector”), accent-color, and Cascade Layers (all of which are covered in my Smashing article), as well as some additional gems:
Trigonometric functions
I almost missed this line when skim-reading the Safari release announcement, but yep, Webkit has delivered support for CSS trigonometric functions! I’m unbelievably excited about the possibilities this will open up for creative CSS, …</p>

          <p>Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you&#x27;ve got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn&#x27;t make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.
To make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.
With layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.
Antetype is also build on web concepts: 
That means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).
Video of Antetype&#x27;s features + prototypes built with it:

(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don&#x27;t want to do it yourself.)
I would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.

          <p>I recently realized that certain kinds of knowledge allow one to be significantly more productive when solving a large class of problems.
For example,
* Regular expressions for simple text processing.
* Parser combinators for parsing.
* Parser generators (esp. packrat variety) for parsing.
* The concept of fuzzing and property testing for testing code.
* Calculus for solving all sorts of problems.
* MCMC for solving a huge class of probability problems.
* Search algorithms for solving a variety of problems (e.g. all NP-hard problems, sudoku, HTNs, scheduling, planning).
* Gradient descent for solving a variety of optimization problems.
* Vector Space embedding as a conceptual tool for a variety of complex AI problems.
* Effect composition (Haskell&#x27;s IO or Scala&#x27;s ZIO) as an incredibly powerful paradigm for concurrency and parallelism.
What are some examples of 10x multipliers that come to your mind? Fundamental ideas without which you would be drastically less productive.

      Florence Studios is a one-woman studio working with independent businesses, to help them grow and grab attention.

Taking the jump into freelance is a big deal! When I first started my freelance journey, I found loads of blog posts from really successful artists and designers that were useful (to some extent). However, it would have been even more helpful to hear from someone who was just a few steps ahead of me in their journey, rather than leaps and bounds in front. For example, advice on approaching clients, honing a freelance workflow, developing as a designer would have been great resources to have.
That’s why I want to sh…</p>

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Chrome 100 has a three digit version number
Take a stroll down memory lane and celebrate
#100CoolWebMoments since Chrome&#x27;s first release.
There are some important changes to the user agent string.
The Multi-Screen Window Placement API
makes it possible to enumerate the displays connected to a user&#x27;s machine,
and place windows on specific screens.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 100.
# Chrome 100
When browsers first reached version 10, there were a few
issues as the major version number went from one digit to two. Hopefully,
we learned a few things that&#x27;ll ease the transition from two digits to three.
Chrome 100 is available now, and Firefox 100 ships very soon. These three
digit version number…</p>

          <p>Google Chrome launched in 2018, and in March 2022 we are celebrating the launch of Chrome version 100 with a scroll down memory lane. #100CoolWebMoments remembers some cool, fun, interesting, and important things that have happened in the past 14 years.
A lot has happened on the web since 2018. If you read Ethan Marcotte’s 2010 A List Apart article on responsive web design on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.
Chrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell and Frances Berriman introduced Progressive Web Apps in 2015, with Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser to replace Internet Explorer in the same year.
In March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with Cascade Layers landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.
Tell us which moments you loved the most. If we&#x27;ve missed anything (and we&#x27;re sure we have), tweet us @ChromiumDev with #100CoolWebMoments.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30817570 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why isn&#x27;t Microsoft good with design consistency?</a>
          <p>With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.
With Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you&#x27;re faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.
This doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I&#x27;d like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they&#x27;re not doing that.
I&#x27;m happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.

          <p>eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

          <p>Recently I started analyzing much more the documents and stylesheets I produce as well as reading more the official CSS and HTML specs. While catering to implementers of user agents, they are generally a goldmine of solid information.
I&#x27;d like also to get inspired by quality work on the web, but inspecting websites pretty much never yields anything that resembles a readable document, HTML semantics and CSS quality are generally in a disastrous state.
Thus my question, can you suggest websites who&#x27;s html and css can be considered of extremely high standards?
I can&#x27;t list many safe for MDN and wikipedia.

          <p>The typical online job site lists millions of jobs. And just about every one of them is a cry for expertise. From the title to the requirements, companies hire for expertise.

          <a href=https://buttmover.com target="_blank">Show HN: Butt Mover, an IRL Productivity and Health Improvement Game</a>
          <p>I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I&#x27;m immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.
Hence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;
1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.
2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.
Those who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.
I&#x27;ve been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.
I hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.

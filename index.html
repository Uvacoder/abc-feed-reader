            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Russian invasion of Ukraine is at once reaffirming all the ills of social media and showing its utterly unique capacity to give a direct voice to anyone around the world. And while the more unfortunate expressions of this being due to &quot;blue eyes and blond hair&quot;, it is fostering a strong sense of fraternity here in Europe. This just is different than a far-away war in Yemen or even Syria. Being upset about the basic human graduation of empathy – that makes us care more about that which is closer and familiar – is an intellectualization straight out of Haidt&#x27;s WEIRD diagnosis.
Being able to read, in real time, about members of the Ukrainian parliament taking up arms, mixed together with pictures of walking the dog, is a deeply humanizing experience. Seeing Zelenskyy tweeting his calls wi…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”
Manos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.
I first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.


Στη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο
που ήξερε και έπαιζε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν
όταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος
φωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Μα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ&#x27; άλλα
κράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν
φασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα
και μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ&#x27; ακορντεόν

Τ&#x27; αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει
όποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν
κι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει
δε θα περάσει ο φασισμός


In my old neighborhood I had a friend
who knew and played the accordion
when he sang, he was like the sun
fires in his hands ignited by the accordion

But at one dark night, like every other night
he kept a look-out playing the accordion
fascist trucks stood in the paddock
and a gun shot stopped the accordion

The started slogan comes back to me
whenever I hear an accordion
and it has marked my life like a stamp
&#x27;Fascism will not prevail!&#x27;</p>

            >Show HN: Hibiki HTML – New License and Bulma UI Controls</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!
The biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now
licensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI
approved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,
commercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.
I&#x27;ve also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -
https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,
tabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a
simple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There
are also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code
highlighting.
Hibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on
JS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,
reuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.
No tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,
no build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.
It works works great for embedding into backend
servers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or
adding dynamic functionality to static sites.
I&#x27;d love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.
If you have a project you&#x27;d like to use Hibiki HTML on, I&#x27;m also happy
to lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you
might need.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When counting text characters in HTML strings, you usually do not want to include the characters in the HTML markup code. While parsing HTML with RegExp does have its limits, in this case, RegExp works very well.</p>

            >Dangerous conversations going private</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I went on Jason Calacanis&#x27; podcast this week for the fourth time. We&#x27;ve had some explosive, illuminating, and contested conversations over the years, Jason and I. And I&#x27;ve loved everyone of them. Whether we were discussing venture capital, profitable businesses, and the definition of success or talking about big tech, education, healthcare, and wealth taxes. Having intense debates about big questions is a thrill. But this last one was different.
Partly because we simply agreed more than we usually do, but also because the topics felt dangerous this time around. Like I ought to weigh my words carefully, lest I open a flank for later attacks. Like every argument ought to be hidden in an armored helmet from inside a protective trench.
In all my appearances on Jason&#x27;s show over the past decade…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The easy problems are often an illusion. If they were real and they were easy, they’d be solved already. Difficult problems, on the other hand, stick around until someone with insight, dedication and commitment shows up and gets to work. Seeking out difficult problems is far more effective than avoiding them.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Throughout history, across the world, humans have shared their culture with others through song. Songs from their faith, country, region, race, culture, subculture, futbol team, or even the local tavern; a shared connection. The following is one of the songs from my community, a lament, I’d like to share with you all.
Been In This War For Too Long: Liturgical Demonstrations From Bygone Days by Seth Woods

G             D           C  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
G                 D  
We’ve got so much hurt  
Remember we’ve fallen so hard  
From our concrete towers to Earth  
Remember we sleep every night  
With doors locked and shades pulled down tight  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  

G             C       G  
We’re already so terrified  
Em                  C  
We just stay in one place  
We just cover our faces  
We just look at our hands  
Em                      C       D  
We just don’t know what time it is  

Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Just could you please be kind  
We’re grateful for so many things  
But you also gave us these minds  
Like you gave us the sky and the trees  
And we couldn’t keep them from harm  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
We’ve wired our hearts with alarm  

We just sit in these chairs now  
We just stare at these screens now  
We just work all the time now  
We just don’t know what day it is  

We’re tired and hungry for dreams now  
We’ve traded our love for relief  
When our casualties rise like black rivers  
From deserts to flood city streets  
Remember your mercies, O Lord  
Please don’t deny us our song  
We’re rambling, restless, and weary  
We’ve been in this war for too long  
We’re black and we’re blue and we’re broke down  
We’ve been in this war for too long

            >The advantages of large, long-running pull requests</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My favorite part of doing code reviews is to see all the trade-offs, design decisions, and changes in context together. You can&#x27;t easily do that if your feature has been chopped into itty bitty pieces as independent pull requests under pressure never to let them run longer than a week. So at Basecamp, we let pull requests run as long as they need to encompass a complete feature or fix. That&#x27;s everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow Shape Up).
This approach isn&#x27;t entirely without trade-offs. The longer your pull request is running off the main branch, the greater the chance that you&#x27;ll have merge conflicts. But you can mitigate much of this by ensuring you keep your pull request up to date with main by frequently merging main into the pull request. I can appreciate…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Starting from Chrome 101, the information available in the User-Agent (UA) string will be reduced using a phased approach. Sites that haven&#x27;t had time to migrate away from using the reduced User-Agent string and move toward User-Agent Client Hints can take part in a deprecation trial to continue receiving the full User-Agent string.
The registration for the deprecation trial will begin with the Chrome 100 Beta. It will allow sites to receive the full User-Agent string ahead of the Chrome 101 release, where the minor version string will be reduced. If you would like to test the origin trial on Chrome 100 Beta before it launches to the stable channel, be sure to register and test before the release date for Chrome 100 (currently scheduled for March 31st, 2022).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The first speakers are live on the UX London 2022 site! There are only five people announced for now—just enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. There will be many, many more.
Putting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.
I’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…
The first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.
The second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">By far the most furiously pushback I&#x27;ve received for writing about the Canadian trucker protest has come from calling it &quot;peaceful&quot;. Objections to this term has taken many forms. But they all seek to justify the opposite label of &quot;violent&quot;, no matter the blind logical leaps required.
Some claim that the background of certain organizers or participants as either anti-government, white supremacist, trumpers, conferate-flag-wavers, or whatever means that even if there were no (or only isolated) violent acts, that this still rendered the protests at large violent. Others that &quot;hateful rhetoric&quot; or &quot;unacceptable views&quot; was violence in speech. Others still that incessant honking or blocked streets constituted violence against the peace and habitability of their city.

Even on spotty 3G connections on the other side of the world, where many of my students live, things still load really quickly (like, 3 seconds or less fast).</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">As someone who&#x27;s been hiring people for 23 years, I&#x27;ve seen, read, and reviewed tens of thousands of job applications.
The ones that typically rise to the top are the ones that demonstrate effort to get this job, and not just any job.
We recently hired our first Email Marketing Manager. Nearly 400 people applied for the position.
As applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.
I wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant&#x27;s permission, although it&#x27;s been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren&#x27;t comfortable sharing publicly.
Beyond it being an exceptionally good application — you&#x27;ll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job. This is who we hired. It&#x27;s a great example of what really wanting the job can look like when you put in the extra effort to stand out in the right ways.

            >Why Self-Care Can Assist You in Stress Management</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Many of us have so many duties in life that we neglect to look after our own needs. This is especially true for those who are responsible for a large number of people. Self-care is a vital element of stress management, even if it&#x27;s difficult to prioritize when you have so many other things on your to-do list.


How Self-Care Can Help You


When we&#x27;re physically and emotionally exhausted, we&#x27;re less equipped to handle the challenges that life throws at us. Or, to put it another way, when we are physically and emotionally at our best, we are more robust and capable of handling life&#x27;s stress. A massage, a hot bath, or some other type of pampering rejuvenates you on the inside and out. Taking time to maintain self-care provides a number of advantages.

            >Show HN: Wachy – A UI for eBPF-based performance debugging</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For years, a trend in our industry has been to build single-page apps, or SPAs.
With an SPA, the entire site or app lives in a single HTML file. After the initial load, everything about the app is handled with JavaScript. This is, in theory, supposed to result in web apps that feel as fast and snappy as native apps.
Today, I want to explore why that’s nonsense. Let’s dig in!</p>

Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real.

It&#x27;s a novel illustration of the point both David Graeber and Yuval Noah Harari have kept making in their works: Human institutions are all, broadly speaking, make believe. 
Where Harari illustrates this point with everything from the corporation to human rights, Graeber invites us to imagine fresh alternatives to debt and capitalism. And I remember nodding to both, but it was Baudrillard&#x27;s pithy contrast that really made the point sink in.
Yet even when it&#x27;s sunk …</p>

We’re playing for $1000. If I win, that money goes to the Bletchley Park Trust. If Matt wins, it goes to The Internet Archive.
I’m very happy to lose this bet.
When I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web. While that pessimism was misplaced in this case, it was informed by data.

In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:
The very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.
That’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
This year marks fifteen years of freelancing in my life. That’s 100% of my work life and nearly half the time I live on this world. So I wrote something down on it on my blog. WDRL itself will turn 10 next year already which amazes me when I think about it. I want to say thank you to all who subscribe to my newsletter, who support me with recommendations to others, with money contributions or other things. You’re keeping this project alive and make it a usually joyful thing to send out a new edition.
To close the intro and dive into the articles, I want to share this mini documentary about my work-life in which I share how I combine web development and market gardening today as well as how to protect yourself from burn-out situations:

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">To say I&#x27;ve been skeptical about Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto universe would be an understatement of epic proportions. Since the early 2010s, some of my most ferocious Twitter battles have been against the HODL army with the laser eyes.
There&#x27;s just so much to oppose: Bitcoin&#x27;s grotesque energy consumption, the ridiculous transaction fees and low throughput, the incessant pump&#x27;n&#x27;dump schemes in shitcoins, the wild price swings in the main coins, the obvious fraud that is Tether, the lack of real decentralization in most of the current web3 infrastructure, and on, and on, and on.
Beyond all these very real problems and challenges, my bigger beef was actually fueled by a lack of imagination. I could see the fundamental promise of a digital currency free of banks if you were living in a…</p>

Do you guys think terminals have a good UX in general ? Any other examples of hilariously unintuitive behavior ?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.
Web Performance And The Planet
Fershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.

Building a Greener Web
My own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.

The Carbon Footprint of Images
Jon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.

You might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!</p>

            >Making a custom clear text field button</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When people add custom clear buttons to their text fields they generally do one of three things: They do not make them accessible at all. They unnecessarily add them to the keyboard focus order of the web page. They ensure the clear buttons are accessible - but not keyboard focusable. The clear button(s) do not show up when their associated fields are readonly or disabled, The button’s respect reading directionality of a web page (e.g., dir&#x3D;rtl), and that keyboard focus returns to the text field once the clear button has been activated.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">apud caecos luscus rex
So-called UX is a scourge.
My experience in industry has been (unsurprisingly) that companies care only for usability insofar as marketability (or lawsuits) are concerned (so looms the shadow of the American Federation for the Blind).
I spent the better part of a year working out how to make a Swing desktop app usable for the blind (not to mention a full prior year of HCI graduate-level training and consultation with a blind PhD. candidate for the same) into something tolerable by prevailing standards, for which I insisted on actual trials by blind users.
Today, I feel like we need an American Federation for the Sighted (or otherwise perceiving) to

Do you have a questionnaire for teams to fill based on the impact and determine if a technical review is required based on the score?
Any other suggestions?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This is a reply to my own blog post: Building an Automated Screenshot Service on Netlify in ~140 Lines of Code.
There is a limitation with the Screenshot Service: when the page you’re taking a screenshot of is slow and/or very large, the request times out. Quoth myself, from ~7 months ago:
What happens if a site is super slow or is currently down?
Netlify Functions have a 10 second execution limit. If the site doesn’t render in 10 seconds, we show a fallback image by default. Currently this is a low-contrast 11ty logo using the same image size as the requested screenshot (via SVG width and height attributes).
While this fallback behavior is okay I was starting to see it more often than I’d like. Why, you might ask? Why would it take more than 10 seconds to fetch a screenshot?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi all, author here.
This project was a pleasure to do, Remix has very good developer experience. But further than that it&#x27;s actually a really good way to develop applications, it&#x27;s a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).
And it turns out that it&#x27;s actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it&#x27;s intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!
You can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.
By the way I&#x27;m currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)

This past month, WebPageTest got a redesigned and reorganized UI. WebPageTest has always been right at home with power users, but with more folks than ever paying attention to performance today, it’s critical that we make WebPageTest easier for everyone.

We’ve written quite a bit already about the new UI (so we’ll keep it brief here) but we’ve been very happy with the feedback we’ve seen f…</p>

            >How to create a search page for a static website with vanilla JS</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">One of the biggest missing features from most static site generators (like Hugo, 11ty, and Jekyll, ) is that they lack built-in search.

Quick aside: done-for-you alternative If you don’t want to roll-your-own search functionality, Algolia and ElasticSearch are two done-for-you search vendors.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">What&#x27;s the goodwill of developers worth to a platform operator? It&#x27;s a hard question, because it can&#x27;t be answered by the traditional economic models used by bean counters to populate the balance sheet. And it&#x27;s far more ephemeral than the goodwill of consumers. The relationship is more intertwined. We&#x27;re not just engaging in transactions, we&#x27;re lifting each other up. Good developers breed strong platforms, and strong platforms attract good developers. When it works, it&#x27;s symbiotic.
There&#x27;s nothing symbiotic about Apple&#x27;s current relationship with its developers. 
Every time Apple mobilizes its law machine to squash a developer in court, foil democratic accountability in the legislatures, or give regulators the middle finger, Apple wounds the relationship with developers. They can win ever…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I suck at CSS. There, I said it.
I&#x27;ve always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let&#x27;s me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.
I understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don&#x27;t.
I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I&#x27;ve gather after a few days, I don&#x27;t understand it.
Instead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don&#x27;t want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.
Ok, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn&#x27;t that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?
I must be missing something, right?

            >Watch out for 12-day weeks</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Way back when, we used to release new software on Fridays all the time. That often meant working Saturdays and Sundays to fix an urgent problem with the new stuff, wrecking the weekend for whoever did the release.
It was stupid yet predictable, because we kept setting deadlines at the end of the week, as most naturally do. But Friday is the worse day to release anything.
First off, you probably rushed to finish before the weekend. So work done on Fridays tends to be a bit sloppy.
Second, Mondays don&#x27;t come after Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays do. So if something goes wrong, someone&#x27;s working the weekend.
Third, if you work the weekends, you don&#x27;t get a chance to recharge. Basically, when you&#x27;ve worked all week, and you&#x27;re forced to work the weekend, the following Monday is the eighth day o…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.
She did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it&#x27;s just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I&#x27;m 100% biased): https://kevin.tw
Fun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn&#x27;t have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Wireframing is the first and the most crucial step in deciding the fate of an application. The right wireframe can make an excellent app – turning an idea perfectly into an app, while a wrong wireframe can break everything. And to make a wireframe perfect, you need a wireframing tool to solve your design purpose.  […]

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m slowly regaining my faith in debates again. You know, the ancient practice of listening, presenting arguments, accepting counterarguments, and progressing towards a deeper shared understanding. Even when the topics are hot. Even when the counterpart is a stranger. And it&#x27;s giving me vintage internet vibes!
Take this Canadian trucker protest, for example. I&#x27;ve heard from a lot of Canadians on the topic. Some support the protests, others don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s clearly a topic where a Canadian might feel like a Dane shouldn&#x27;t have standing to participate in the discussion (and plenty do!). Yet literally all the many debates I&#x27;ve had over the past week since writing about this topic have managed to be civil and respectful despite also occasionally being tense. Remarkable.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When I first arrived in Australia from the UK in early 2012, I witnessed the WEIRDEST thing….


I was driving along a country back road ‘out bush’, when I noticed the Department of Parks and Wildlife trucks making a roadblock.  


A tunnel of thick black smoke filled the hot summer air just beyond them, billowing and undulating aggressively as if it was sent by the Devil himself to annihilate all life on Earth.


I stopped at the roadblock, mesmerized by the ferocity of nature, when I saw the weird thing…


Men and women, wearing fluorescent yellow onesies were deliberately setting fire to the bushland. 


Deliberately!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today, we’re going to talk about a tried-and-true performance recommendation that’s not so tried or true anymore: CDN caching.
Let’s dig in!
The old best-practice around CDNs For years, one of the big performance recommendations with large JavaScript and CSS libraries was to host it from a shared CDN.
Take jQuery, for example. The idea was simple: someone visits catsarethebest.com, where they’re loading jquery.1.1.8.js from the jQuery CDN. Then, that same person visits dogsarebetter.</p>

If you&#x27;re seeing this video, it is Monday, February 14—Yep.
Which means that I am now very excited to announce that effective today, Netlify will be sponsoring full-time development of Eleventy!
Eleventy started with the very basic idea that the tools we use to make websites should be simpler for both beginners and experts, and we are still working very hard to continue to deliver on that mission today.
This announcement is such huge news for our project in multiple ways: the project&#x27;s longevity, sustainability, delivery of features, integrations fixes enabling folks to take on even larger scale projects (if this sounds like your project, please get in touch).
This is one small part of Netlify&#x27;s larger strategy to invest in an ecosystem of frameworks and tools to make building for the web easier, more resilient, and more scalable. I&#x27;m now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.
And personally speaking, I&#x27;m just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.
I&#x27;m grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn&#x27;t a prerequisite.
And I don&#x27;t know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we&#x27;re going to find out what it really feels like to run.
Stay tuned.</p>

            >Implementing A Svelte Store In Rust</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We’re going to build a Svelte store, written in Rust, and run it in an Electron app.
This spun out of a video editor which I originally built in Swift. It turns out people on Windows want to edit videos too, so now I’m rewriting it with Rust, Electron, and Svelte with an eye for performance.
Rust is a systems programming language, akin to C or C++, but safer. It’s known for being super fast.
Electron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty. But there’s an ace up its sleeve: Electron apps can be extended with compiled native code, and if you do the heavy stuff in native code you can a nice speed boost.
Svelte is a JavaScript UI framework – an alternative to React, Vue, Angular, or one of the other 750…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s not the “gold.” It’s the “rush” that changes the way people behave. When consumed by a gold rush, people make decisions that they would never make on ordinary days. They trust entities, make assumptions and suspend disbelief. Not because there’s gold on the line, but because everyone else is rushing, and the fear of […]</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It might be unusual for a web developer, but up until recently I’d never had an ad blocker installed. I use Firefox as my main browser, which claims to protect privacy by blocking trackers. And to be honest, I don’t read a lot of articles on desktop, preferring to read the news on mobile while I’m on the go. While you might get one or two pop-ups on mobile, the area available for them is clearly a lot smaller, and I generally find the browsing experience for many of the sites I regularly visit is OK.
Most of the sites I do visit on desktop are for my day-to-day job, or research for this blog, and are built with developers as the target audience. I haven’t noticed any/many annoying popups or slow-loading pages on these sites, probably because I know which sites can be trusted to provide qua…</p>

EVERY Gundam Timeline Explained - Tim Lyu breaks down every Gundam timeline and series in an incredible and obsessive fashion. I also watched his Evangelion breakdown too. youtube.com
Scams, Art Theft and NFTs - I like Brad Colbow’s thinking, from an artist’s perspective, around NFTs. youtube.com
Make Free Stuff - Max Böck touches on one of my biggest concerns with Web3 in that it attempts “to impose even more artificial locks and transactions on users, to extract even more money”, getting away from the Web’s anti-capitalist beginnings. mxb.dev
Omnichord - Jake Albaugh makes a free musical instrument using the Web Audio API. And it’s fun. Also, subdomains rule. omnichord.jake.fun
nuxt-cms-template - Alex Riviere and Andrew Walpole figured out how to integrate Netlify CMS’s block-based editor and preview feature with a Nuxt application. It may not sound like a big deal but getting a React app and a Nuxt app working together without creating a turducken is pretty intuitive. github.com

 The decision, by Landgericht München’s third civil chamber in Munich, found that the website, by including Google-Fonts-hosted font on its pages, passed the unidentified plaintiff’s IP address to Google without authorization and without a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>

After a decade&#x27;s worth of front-end progress kept demanding ever more complicated setups, we&#x27;re finally moving in the opposite direction.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just encountered a sneaky thing I had not seen, although it probably worked in 1999 already. A web site was showing a different title on the tab, depending on it being active or not. The whole trick is to use the blur and focus event handlers on the window to change the title. window.onblur […]</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On Tuesday, I wrote about DRY programing, and how it’s actually OK to repeat yourself.
Someone pointed me to this article by Kent C. Dodds from two years ago on AHA programing as a nice follow-up read.
 AHA (pronounced “Aha!” like you just made a discovery) is an acronym I got from Cher Scarlett which stands for “Avoid Hasty Abstractions.”
The way I think of this principle is beautifully described by Sandi Metz who wrote: “prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now without any form of covid restrictions in Denmark. The daily infection numbers have remained as high as they were when the restrictions were dropped, and the positivity rate for tests is still a staggering 30%. And yet, Danish society has simply moved on.
At our kids&#x27; school, it seems that virtually everyone has had omicron by now. With anecdotes ranging from no symptoms at all to the majority experiencing mild colds to a few with flu-like symptoms. The majority of teachers have now also been through an infection, so the churn of substitutes is basically over as well.
Danish health authorities are pretty excited about all of this. Omicron is basically heralded as a blessing. The ticket out of the pandemic. By infecting the majority of Danes, society will hav…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the past few months I&#x27;ve been taking guitar lessons from a friend of mine who happens to be an exceptional teacher. I got lucky.
I used to play years ago, but probably only retained 10% of what I knew, so I was as close to starting from scratch as any barely-experienced player could be. Basically, I could dabble and play some chords, but my skills plateaued quickly after that. And it&#x27;s a lonely, desolate, tumbleweedy-flat plateau. You don&#x27;t get better hanging out there.
So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m back to in-person lessons. I tried YouTube, I tried some books, I tried an app or two, I tried a bunch of stuff, but I&#x27;ve discovered I simply learn guitar best with one-on-one in-person instruction.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Yesterday, I had the pleasure of chatting with Chris Bongers about how I became the vanilla JS guy.
We talked about how I got into web development after years as an HR professional, how I made the career switch, the viability of CSS as a career path, and why I got into JavaScript.
We also talked a fair bit about the value of sharing everything you learn, and the power of daily writing.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Canadian truckers have now for almost two weeks faced insults, threats, and slander to protest the country&#x27;s new vaccine mandates. With a persistence that is driving some progressives both inside and outside of Canada absolutely batty. How dare these truckers continue to exercise their basic political rights to freedom of assembly, association, and speech?!
Even more frustrating to the queue of disparaging observers seems to be the peaceful nature of these protests. While honking horns and blocking roads is surely thinning the patience of nearby residents, it&#x27;s hardly the kind of actions that would warrant sending in the military. Which is rather inconvenient if you&#x27;d really like the military to use its force against your domestic, political opponents!

I want to sell a few items (handmade) but I don&#x27;t want my store to look like any other e-commerce store. Ideally, I&#x27;d want it to look like a game  where my customer avatars can walk around and pick up items like they do in a physical store.
Any tips and tricks on where to start looking? Or am I off my rocker?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Spring is the season for new beginnings, a time to renew and recharge.  But more importantly just as we do a regular ‘spring clean’ of our home to declutter our personal space we should also be focused on a ‘spring cleanup for our mind’ as well.   


After all, it is your mental thoughts that create your life’s destiny


Declutter your mind, what a fabulous idea!  Begin to rid yourself of any negative thoughts and behaviours you have harbored from the past in order to live a fulfilling life now.   Let’s use a seed we plant in the earth as an analogy.  With enough nurturing and care that seed will bloom into a beautiful plant or flower.   However, at the same time if you are not taking care of it weeds will begin to grow and the plant will die off and wither away from a lack of attention.

In particular, we have greatly appreciated all who have offered considerate feedback, as some of that feedback has already made its way into improving the product!
While in many ways, this release is just another refinement in our ongoing product iteration, it also involved some relatively big changes. In fact, enough has changed around here that perhaps it&#x27;s helpful to first acknowledge what has not: our content, features, and functionality.
Still, things do look a bit different! So in this post, I&#x27;ll aim to detail many of the goals and design decisions behind what&#x27;s changed, and even share a little about where we&#x27;re headed…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m not planning on leaving the industry (yet), but before I go I’d like to offer up what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.
I have logged hundreds of hours complaining about browsers on Twitter, on podcasts, and on this blog. I have logged thousands more hours trying to keep up with browsers and I frequently interact with people who write specs and make browsers. I have not been 100% successful in my efforts to get a  element as my legacy but I have learned a lot about giving feedback to web browsers.
Browsers are really complex
Eric Meyer recently put it very well…
[W]eb browsers are actually 60fps+ rendering environments.  They’re First-Person Scrollers.
When you complain about browsers, the first thing you must know is: Browsers are big, complex pieces of s…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last week, Ali Spittel tweeted…
 Don’t repeat yourself too much, but also don’t abstract your code to an extent that it is not understandable.
 In programing, DRY is an acronym that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s good advice that’s sometimes treated as a Holy Grail in coding.
Sometimes, a little repeated code a good thing. Today, I wanted to look at some specific examples of when DRY is good, and when it creates more problems than it solves.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Infinity is a great idea, but unless you’re doing math, it’s mostly an idea. Everything else in our world has limits. It’s the limits that make it interesting, the limits that give us an edge to the box, something to leverage against. Instead of denying the existence of limits and the trade-offs that they bring […]</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On Twitter, Kyle Shevlin was talking about how at the end of a software engineering interview, they’ll often offer a painfully-small amount of time to ask some of your own questions.
The worst part is, I often just blank in the 5 minute question time. I’ll come up with something because I’m good on my feet, but deep down it feels ineffectual. I’m not getting what I need in that time period, so let me just use the bathroom before the next interview.
— @kyleshevlin
I mentioned that I had a go-to list of questions that I literally printed and brought with me, and would bring out during this 5-minute lightning round. I definitely felt like a huge nerd pulling a set of printed questions out of a binder.
But it turned out to be really helpful, and at a couple of these interviews, my interviewer …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like a lot of the time learning new CSS features doesn’t involve just learning a what a single property does, more like getting to grips with a collection of properties and how they work together — even learning a whole specification. That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …</p>

The shared masthead navigation (across various tech-stacks) on Netlify Community (Vue/Eleventy), Remotely Interesting Podcast (Eleventy), Netlify Explorers (Next.js), Netlify Swag (Gatsby.js), and Netlify Answers (Discourse).

I’ve decided to finally package those  helpers up and formally release them as a web component!

            >Ask HN: What should I do with my phone checking habit?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I have a well established phone checking habit.
If I&#x27;m developing and my tests are running I pick up my phone. If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what&#x27;s happening on it. If I&#x27;m working on a problem and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).
I don&#x27;t like the habit, but I have it.
I used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.
There are two directions I can go in (I think):
1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)
2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).
Does anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?
Does anyone have any success getting more comfortable &quot;holding&quot; the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik&#x27;s cube?!)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">So I&#x27;ve been working on a productivity app, and I struggle to get new users. I don&#x27;t want to buy ads because I&#x27;m not sure if it has reached PMF, and I&#x27;ve almost used all of my organic source. How did you get your first 1000 DAU as a consumer productivity/utility app?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My friend Scott O’Hara is an accessibility specialist.
His blog is a trove of goodness. A few weeks ago, he wrote about how the div element isn’t as terrible as some people make it out to be.
But today, I wanted to share a recent post he wrote on how to announce content to screen reader users.
 Live regions are elements that inform assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that their descendant content may update.</p>

Programming assignments could involve making changes to open source word processors.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You couldn’t have planned a better advertising campaign for crypto than Gofundme’s ham-fisted cancelation of donations intended for the protesting Canadian truckers. Their first attempt would literally have re-routed donations for the truckers to “other charities”. That sounded so crazy when I first read it that I had to dig up multiple confirming sources to believe it to be true. But true enough it was!


Thankfully, this original plan was revised after Gofundme got some “donor feedback”, including from the likes of Elon Musk (what a timeline we’re living in!). The new plan will “just” block the donations from reaching their intended recipients, and result in refunds 7-10 days(!!) from now. What a conveniently long time to keep $10 million locked up, and unable to support the protesting t…</p>

Yes, I know that the week finishes on Friday, but Fridays have been declared the no-meetings day at Clearleft: a chance to concentrate on heads-down work without interruption. Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.
At this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week. Once that’s all taken care of, the Thursday afternoon meeting often finishes with a fun activity.

I&#x27;d seen this before and suspected that the game couldn&#x27;t be loaded due to corruption during boot (on the GB side). I was wrong, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge!

Opening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:

Pins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:

And now the Gameboy boots with a nice clean Nintendo logo. Except… it doesn&#x27;t go past that point at all - and in fact the screen looks like it&#x27;s doing some weird flash dance, goi…</p>

One that grants themselves the right to audit the books of any developer who dares refuse Apple&#x27;s own in-app payment system, still collects a preposterous 27% of the economic activity, and mandates a scary-sounding disclaimer to discourage users from even trying it.

The document.createElement() method You can use the document.createElement() method to create an element. Pass in the element to create, without angled brackets (), as an argument
let div &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;div&#x27;); let link &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;a&#x27;); let article &#x3D; document.createElement(&#x27;article&#x27;);  You can use any valid HTML tag, and even create custom ones, too.</p>

And no, my site—prior to this week—was not hosted on Netlify.
Why? Pure, unadulterated procrastination. I should have moved it over sooner. I’m very glad to have made the move. Let’s do a quick summary of the process and the pitfalls I ran into—as well as the benefits I’m seeing after the migration.

Let’s dig in!
The Element.innerHTML property You can use the Element.innerHTML property to get and set the HTML content inside an element as a string.
 
Hello world!
 let greeting &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;.greeting&#x27;); // Get HTML content // returns &quot;
Hello world!
&quot; let html &#x3D; greeting.innerHTML; // Set HTML content // This replaces what was in there already greeting.</p>

Ideally, I can outsource most of this to a good web dev agency. We are in the MLOps space, and so some domain knowledge from the agency would be great (or the ablity to learn about the space and incorporate it into the design). Does anyone have any good recs for an agency like this?

            >The second-hand stress of social media</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;d been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since retiring from the back-and-forth, it&#x27;s clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.
This is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I&#x27;d be surprised if you aren&#x27;t aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it&#x27;s a shock to the system.
That shock isn&#x27;t the problem, though. It&#x27;s the solution. It&#x27;s your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, producing everything from ulcers to heart disease.
I think most people already know this, but I don&#x27;t think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries. That&#x27;s a longitudinal study I&#x27;d love to see. (Blessed be those selected for the control group!)</p>

Got COVID
When I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.
Thankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tel…</p>

# Remove Battery Status API on insecure origins
Battery Status API is no longer supported on insecure origins,
such as HTTP pages or HTTPS iframes embedded in HTTP pages. The Battery Status
API allows web developers to access, among other things, a system&#x27;s battery
charging level and whether it is being charged. It is a powerful feature that
has been around for over a decade and, as such, was originally designed with
different security constraints.

On iOS devices, Apple bans the use of alternative browser engines – this means that Apple has a monopoly over the supply of browser engines on iOS. It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine. This restriction has 2 main effects:
limiting rival browsers’ ability to differentiate themselves from Safari on factors such as speed and functionality, meaning that Safari faces less competition from other browsers than it otherwise could do; and
limiting the functionality of web apps – which could be an alternative to n…</p>

December 1, 2010 - February 1, 2022   If you’ve been following me for a while, you may already be familiar Bailey, my black lab mix. Yesterday, she passed away at home after several years of liver issues.
When we adopted Bailey 12 years ago, we were looking for a small dog. She was listed as a “chihuahua/rat terrier mix,” expected to be about 15 pounds. Then 20 pounds came and went.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For Rogan&#x27;s own sake, and for all of our sakes, I hope we&#x27;ll soon move on from picking apart every facet of his popular podcast. But before we do, just one more thing. Really 😂
In this whole saga, I must admit to a guilty pleasure of chuckling at all the folks infuriated by the fact that Rogan commands such popularity from his off-the-cuff approach. Here&#x27;s his own presentation of his style:

These podcasts are very strange because they’re just conversations. And oftentimes I have no idea what I’m going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people. And that’s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I’m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and they’re just conversations, and I think that’s also the appeal of the show. It’s one of the things tha…</p>

            >Work unites what politics divide</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It&#x27;s quite literally a creative force.
When you&#x27;re focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.
This is the wisdom of the Mark Twain&#x27;s etiquette &quot;never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company&quot;. Specifically the point about &quot;polite company&quot;. It&#x27;s the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.
All this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People&#x27;s religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. 
Today social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people&#x27;s stances on the thorniest issues. It&#x27;s often hard not to know someone&#x27;s leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.
But it&#x27;s worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That&#x27;s the choice of the creative force.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We had our YouTube channel for &quot;erpnext&quot; and a few videos in an older channel called &quot;webnotestech&quot;. To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main &quot;erpnext&quot; account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!
I am a pretty proficient user and I wasn&#x27;t drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.
My feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than &quot;Feedback&quot;. To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.
If any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
It is January February already, and it feels like time flies. In the world of technology, there are always so many news, trends, and possible distractions. On top of that, we already have so much work to do, projects to finish, and people to please. It is easy to feel empty or get burned out. Plus, we still live in the middle of an uncomfortable situation for everyone, a so far unseen pandemic situation; This causes a lot of mental problems on its own and drains a lot of energy from us.
What we can do in this case — although it’s hard to accept — is slowing down.
When I feel overwhelmed, I try to go outside as much as possible. I will get some fresh air, have a long walk and reflect on the things I do. I try to answer the question: »What brings me joy in web development?«. After that,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In last week’s article on the ideal browser support strategy in 2022, I wrote:
 Things can fail if JS is unsupported if they’re “nice to have” features. Anything critical needs to work without JavaScript.
 In response, reader Caleb Stauffer asked how I would handle a flyout or drawer nav menu (“think mobile with a hamburger icon” - shared with permission).
I’ve mostly moved away from that pattern in general, but if I did need to use it for something today, I would either…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey!
Back again with another installment of Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something. So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
While this is a video, it&#x27;s really about sound. If you like cars, or simply dig physics, I bet you&#x27;ll find this video (and audio) fascinating. I sure did. Why do engines sound they way they do? I was surprised by what I heard. 
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ygGmLbzuBU4
Read Something
While this is an article, it&#x27;s the little looping video that blew my mind. Scientists at the University of Vermont, Tufts University and Harvard University&#x27;s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering said they have discovered an entirely new form of biological reproduction different from any animal or plant known to science. Absolutely fascinating.

Saw Something
This brief video on Dutch street design and safety hones in specifically on the concept of continuous sidewalks. I remember noticing this when we spent time in Amsterdam a few years back, and it struck me as absolutely obvious, yet completely foreign to my eyes. BTW, I can&#x27;t wait to get back to Amsterdam — love that place. 
See it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9OfBpQgLXUc
Until next time.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># The permissions UX until now
When a user visits a site that requests a permission, a bubble pops up to prompt the user to make a
decision. For example, below you can see the geolocation permission prompt as implemented in Chrome
up to version 96. (You can try this and other permissions on our demo site
permission.site.)
# Most permission prompts are ignored or dismissed
Chrome&#x27;s telemetry data proves that a lot of permission prompts are ignored. You can explore the
notification permission data
in the Chrome UX report yourself. For now, consider the table below that shows
how Windows users reacted to the geolocation and the notification prompts on sites in an accumulated way:
Action
Percent of geolocation prompts
Percent of notification prompts

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Episode 28: by Mark Cogan in Paris, France (January, 2022)
Previous episodes
In 2022, Chrome on iOS will celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Chrome is one of the most widely used iOS apps—it&#x27;s currently the number 2 Utility app in the US App Store.
Chrome on iOS provides all of the great Chrome features our users love, including Sync, Translate, Incognito, Password Manager, Autofill, and many more.
Chrome on iOS also integrates with native iOS features such as multi-window and device-wide password autofill.
However, there&#x27;s one major thing that makes Chrome on iOS very different from all other Chrome platform implementations.
Chrome on iOS doesn&#x27;t use Blink.
Because of Apple&#x27;s App Store rules, Chrome on iOS has to use the iOS platform APIs for fetching and rendering web content. So Chrome on i…</p>

            >New in Chrome 98</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
If you’ve tried the Auto Dark Theme origin trial, there’s a new way to
opt out at a per element level.
There’s now support for COLRv1, an evolution of the COLRv0 font
format.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 98.
# Opting out of auto-dark themes on Android
In Chrome 96, we started an origin trial for
Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, if your site is light themed and the user’s OS is in dark
mode, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to your site.
If you&#x27;ve signed up for the origin trial, and you want to opt out of the
automatically generated dark theme for a specific page, you can use a meta tag.

Or you can opt-ou…</p>

            >Cascade layers are coming to your browser</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Cascade layers (the @layer CSS rule) are coming to Chromium 99, Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4 Beta. They enable more explicit control of your CSS files to prevent style-specificity conflicts. This is particularly useful for large codebases, design systems, and when managing third party styles in applications.
Layering your CSS in a clear way prevents unexpected style overrides and promotes better CSS architecture.
# CSS specificity and the cascade
CSS specificity is how CSS decides which styles to apply to which elements. The different selectors you can use  determine the specificity of any style rule. For example, elements are less specific than classes or attributes, which are in turn less specific than IDs. This is an elemental part of learning CSS.
Folks turn to CSS naming conventions li…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.
It’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass.

If you understand it, you&#x27;ll achieve a greater level of confidence that benefits you in many ways. You&#x27;ll gain more happiness, higher self-esteem, and more opportunities. Fail to understand it, and the consequences can be nasty.

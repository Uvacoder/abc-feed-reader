          <p>Im currently exploring the design of an account and role based permissions system.
Im trying to look for and find standard patterns (if any) for structuring user accounts, organisations, sub organisations and products.
It would need to handle:
1. Role based permissions
2. Roll up billing
My initial thoughts are:
1. A user account is unique but can be a member of 1 or more organisations.
2. An organisation could have one or more sub organisations. 
3. An organisation (or sub organisation) would be subscribed to one or more products
4. A the product level, the user would have role based permissions to provide access to certain features.
How would you best design something like this from a rule / hierarchy perspective?
Would you apply role based permissions at every level for the user?

          <p>Hello, i am a part time/student worker as Frontend Developer. Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.
I saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.
My experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?
I can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular. Am i alone?

Specifically their wallpaper and desktop layout - with all their usual windows open at the ready.
Alternatively if any of you are happy to share screenshots of your custom UI designs I would love to see them!

          <p>I sometimes spot colleagues making design decisions that seem really bad to me. A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like &quot;how does this compare to open source library X&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I&#x27;m not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.

          <p>Hey all, I&#x27;m looking to level-up my API design game and thought a solid book on the topic could be great, but I&#x27;m having a hard time picking out signal from noise in the sea of publications. Especially considering some recommendations out there are a decade+ old, when things have changed significantly in certain areas (like browser tech) since then.
Primarily thinking about web APIs (meaning REST these days) but anything goes. Guiding principles &gt;&gt; &quot;how to build an API in framework Foo&quot;!
Have you got any suggestions? Thanks!

          <p>Hi HN!
While working on a project that requires some images of keyboard shortcuts to be put in documentation, I came up with the idea of this small design tool.
kcaps.app is quite simple, however, it provides a number of color schemes and allows users to quickly print or press keyboard combinations and download images as a result.
I hope it will be helpful for someone else :)

          <p>Hey,
if you read this email, it’ll be technically different from the previous. When I recently updated my newsletter service server software nearly everything broke into pieces. I was using mailtrain v1 for a long time now but it’s deprecated and using old node versions. Upgrading to v2 wasn’t easy enough for me and I also wanted to have an easier to maintain mailer anyway. The new email is sent via Spatie’s Laravel Mailcoach. So far it’s a pretty manual process again since it doesn’t support RSS-campaigns. At some point in future I want to publish the newsletter via Kirby to the Mailcoach API.
But at this point I now changed my template as well to a modern MJML based template code. This should hopefully fix all the rendering issues you reported to me recently. I tried to support light and…</p>

          <p>It can be super fun to work with teams on unique and exciting products, but the real success of virtually any product begins and ends with the user. It’s as simple as this: no users, no product.
This begs the question, how can you create great products for your users?
When you incorporate great UX design principles into your product, your users will have a better experience. Great UX starts with great user research.
Excellent user research can help your team with scheduling and technical feasibility. It can also provide much-needed insights into your users with cross-functional applications (think of your marketing department).

          <p>It seems that the tech community accepts certain dogma in releasing products &quot;MVP, agile, user-centered design, user studies, etc&quot;.
Yet if these principles are being followed, why does the industry keep pumping low quality products, while Apple is the opposite?
Apple&#x27;s secrecy does not help. The few articles on google were either outdated (Job&#x27;s legacy) or blog with opinions and speculations.
What are they doing right that most tech companies miss? Or is it not design, but a distinctive leadership and strategy that works?
Some &quot;more verifiable&quot; sources:

Would love to hear from insiders if possible, thanks.

          <p>Hi all,
My name is Simone Di Nuovo and i&#x27;m the creator of tilepieces, an open source project to visually editing HTML documents and Web applications.
Tilepieces is a software that allows you to create applications for editing HTML documents, using some of the popular interfaces of the browser developer tools (with which it is possible to integrate css edits).
Tilepieces also allows you to reuse your favorite code and libraries, and exposes APIs that are useful for editing multiple files at a time.
You can start using tilepieces with its progressive web application version at https://pwa.tilepieces.net!
I will be happy to receive any comments from you.

          <p>Screenshot from a Codepen demo. Hovering on a grid item expands the grid tracks.

Somehow it’s already three months since I wrote about the CSS :has() pseudo-class landing in Safari Technology preview. The latest Safari (proper) release has just shipped with support, and can be enabled with a flag in the next Chrome release.
Meanwhile, I’ve been playing around with some ideas on how we can use :has() for styling a gallery or product grid layout. One of the cool things about the selector is that it allows us to not only style a parent element based on any one of its children, but to also style that child’s siblings too. So, building a menu, we could apply some styles to other elements in the menu when one of the links is hovered:
/* Style the list border when link is hovered */

          <p>I booked myself a week off work in late Feb and leading up to that date I started to get (back) into Gameboys. As a kid I grew up with a ZX Spectrum in the home and as a teen I had a Gameboy. I actually managed to use paper-round money to buy myself a pretty nice collection of games, but then for some reason sold it all off - only to then want to re-buy a Gameboy. I wasn&#x27;t so business savvy at that point.
Early on in the year I found that refurbishing Gameboys and modding them wasn&#x27;t too tricky for my own skills and as Feb started to come around two lots on Ebay piqued my interest: one with 8 Gameboys and another with 14. Of the 14, none worked (according to the seller) and of the 8, one worked (a Gameboy Advanced).
After much stress of bidding, I managed to secure the lots, plus purchased…</p>

          <p>One day I came across this video about Muharrem, a deaf man, and how his whole neighborhood conspired against him for a surprise.

Here I am, crying at my desk, moved to tears by an advertisement for a Samsung product in Turkey. You watch as Muharrem’s expression moves from confused, to disbelief, to overwhelm. Muharrem tears up, I tear up. Imagine what it must feel like to leave your house and the mismatch you feel every day got erased; the world works for you in a way that it didn’t before.
What if…

          <p>Corporate networks have lots of resources around good practice: partitioning, zero trust, vlans etc. But home  networks seem to me to be a giant attack surfaces, and incredibly juicy targets.
What constitutes modern best practice for the design and implementation of secure, performant home networks? Im thinking there must be more than NAT, tossing Alexa in the garbage and crossed fingers.

          <p>Next.js’ recent 12.0 release included a new beta feature: middleware.

          <p>There’s a bit of a setup to this song: Big Bird is pouting in his nest, jealous of the new baby Cody which gets a lot of attention. The whole street is concerned about Big Bird. If you ask me, Big Bird is being a bit of a bitch about it all but clearly he’s going through some strong feelings. The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie1 comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.
“Different people, different ways” has been a useful parenting tool. It helps us resolve unfairness in moments of sibling rivalry, but also helps in explaining differences of the human condition. Why do they use a wheelchair? Why are they short? Why do they talk lik…</p>

It’s certainly an exciting time to be working on the web right now, with browser support for new features moving along at lightning-fast pace! This month saw Safari drop a new release that includes support for a tonne of new stuff, including :has() (A.K.A. the “parent selector”), accent-color, and Cascade Layers (all of which are covered in my Smashing article), as well as some additional gems:
Trigonometric functions
I almost missed this line when skim-reading the Safari release announcement, but yep, Webkit has delivered support for CSS trigonometric functions! I’m unbelievably excited about the possibilities this will open up for creative CSS, …</p>

          <p>Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you&#x27;ve got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn&#x27;t make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.
To make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.
With layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.
Antetype is also build on web concepts: 
That means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).
Video of Antetype&#x27;s features + prototypes built with it:

(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don&#x27;t want to do it yourself.)
I would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.

          <p>I recently realized that certain kinds of knowledge allow one to be significantly more productive when solving a large class of problems.
For example,
* Regular expressions for simple text processing.
* Parser combinators for parsing.
* Parser generators (esp. packrat variety) for parsing.
* The concept of fuzzing and property testing for testing code.
* Calculus for solving all sorts of problems.
* MCMC for solving a huge class of probability problems.
* Search algorithms for solving a variety of problems (e.g. all NP-hard problems, sudoku, HTNs, scheduling, planning).
* Gradient descent for solving a variety of optimization problems.
* Vector Space embedding as a conceptual tool for a variety of complex AI problems.
* Effect composition (Haskell&#x27;s IO or Scala&#x27;s ZIO) as an incredibly powerful paradigm for concurrency and parallelism.
What are some examples of 10x multipliers that come to your mind? Fundamental ideas without which you would be drastically less productive.

      Florence Studios is a one-woman studio working with independent businesses, to help them grow and grab attention.

Taking the jump into freelance is a big deal! When I first started my freelance journey, I found loads of blog posts from really successful artists and designers that were useful (to some extent). However, it would have been even more helpful to hear from someone who was just a few steps ahead of me in their journey, rather than leaps and bounds in front. For example, advice on approaching clients, honing a freelance workflow, developing as a designer would have been great resources to have.
That’s why I want to sh…</p>

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
Chrome 100 has a three digit version number
Take a stroll down memory lane and celebrate
#100CoolWebMoments since Chrome&#x27;s first release.
There are some important changes to the user agent string.
The Multi-Screen Window Placement API
makes it possible to enumerate the displays connected to a user&#x27;s machine,
and place windows on specific screens.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 100.
# Chrome 100
When browsers first reached version 10, there were a few
issues as the major version number went from one digit to two. Hopefully,
we learned a few things that&#x27;ll ease the transition from two digits to three.
Chrome 100 is available now, and Firefox 100 ships very soon. These three
digit version number…</p>

          <p>Google Chrome launched in 2018, and in March 2022 we are celebrating the launch of Chrome version 100 with a scroll down memory lane. #100CoolWebMoments remembers some cool, fun, interesting, and important things that have happened in the past 14 years.
A lot has happened on the web since 2018. If you read Ethan Marcotte’s 2010 A List Apart article on responsive web design on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.
Chrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell and Frances Berriman introduced Progressive Web Apps in 2015, with Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser to replace Internet Explorer in the same year.
In March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with Cascade Layers landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.
Tell us which moments you loved the most. If we&#x27;ve missed anything (and we&#x27;re sure we have), tweet us @ChromiumDev with #100CoolWebMoments.</p>

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30817570 target="_blank">Ask HN: Why isn&#x27;t Microsoft good with design consistency?</a>
          <p>With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.
With Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you&#x27;re faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.
This doesn&#x27;t seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I&#x27;d like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they&#x27;re not doing that.
I&#x27;m happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.

          <p>eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.
However, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it&#x27;s quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.

          <p>Recently I started analyzing much more the documents and stylesheets I produce as well as reading more the official CSS and HTML specs. While catering to implementers of user agents, they are generally a goldmine of solid information.
I&#x27;d like also to get inspired by quality work on the web, but inspecting websites pretty much never yields anything that resembles a readable document, HTML semantics and CSS quality are generally in a disastrous state.
Thus my question, can you suggest websites who&#x27;s html and css can be considered of extremely high standards?
I can&#x27;t list many safe for MDN and wikipedia.

          <a href=https://buttmover.com target="_blank">Show HN: Butt Mover, an IRL Productivity and Health Improvement Game</a>
          <p>I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I&#x27;m immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.
Hence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;
1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.
2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.
Those who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.
I&#x27;ve been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.
I hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.

          <p>One of the best things about being an ad designer is working on a wide range of projects and client accounts.

So how can you help clients give you approval faster? Let’s look at a few simple strategies you can use to keep the work a-flowing.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been looking to increase my use of the keyboard, primarily for the productivity gains that I find myself able to reach by consistently sticking to the keyboard. Since I started though, I&#x27;ve noticed fairly uneven support across applications. For example, reviewing my day&#x27;s worth of meetings and responding to each invitation using Google calendar is very painful to do on the keyboard.
What are people&#x27;s favorite recommendations of keyboard-based productivity tools?

          <p>I&#x27;m browsing with JS and cookies disabled for speed and safety. Lately, more and more simple and plain blogs require JS to show any text on website. Can we just agree on letting basic html do it&#x27;s thing? Why insist on JS to be able to show simple text on webpage?
For example:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;30725933
Go ahead, disable JS and try opening blog on this link. Won&#x27;t happen...
This page is simple dark text on white background with some images sprinkled in. Why is JS required to show this?
I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in this...

          <p>You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:
There is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.
It certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.
I hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.

          <p># What is CHIPS?
Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) is a Privacy Sandbox proposal that allows developers to opt a cookie into &quot;partitioned&quot; storage, with separate cookie jars per top-level site.
A partitioned third-party cookie is tied to the top-level site where it&#x27;s initially set and cannot be accessed from elsewhere. The aim is to allow cookies to be set by a third-party service, but only read within the context of the top-level site where they were initially set.
# Who is the origin trial for?
This trial is available as a third-party origin trial, which enables providers of embedded content to try out a new feature across multiple sites.
If a site enrolls in the trial as a first-party, the cookie partitioning functionality will be available to any third-party content …</p>

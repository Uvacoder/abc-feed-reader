          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31546814 target="_blank">Ask HN: How do you design experiments on yourself? (health, energy, learning)</a>
          <p>How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?
Examples of experiments:
 - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.
 - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.
 - Try intermittent fasting.
 - Start writing tests first (TDD).
I wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the &quot;scientific method&quot; on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.

          <p>Mine: overlay on video (especially when they&#x27;re not full screened).
They&#x27;re often too obstructive for no reason (often has a too large dark gradient that blocks bottom or top of the video), takes forever to disappear, and hard to operate (very easy to accidentally pause the video). For example, CC button for YouTube: it totally could be below the video element.
This is especially annoying on mobile since there is not keyboard shortcuts.

The big three live outside in the side yard and those last two live in piles in my garage until I can’t handle looking at them anymore.
The side yard has three enormous trash bins. The compost is always empty. The trash fills up, but we can atomic elbow that last bag in there. No problem.

          <p>I know I’m not alone in browsing hacker news on my phone.
On mobile devices the flag/hide buttons are super close to the article and comment links. I hit them all the time unintentionally.
Maybe hacker news could throw an @media section in the CSS and make the links large enough to avoid accidental taps on mobile?
I have the same development philosphy as HN, roughly doing a minimal implementation that is close to what the machine requires. But I also value an interface that humans can use. I think with a couple lines of code HN could make this more usable without corrupting the spirit of a no-frills website.

Chrome 103 beta was released on May 26, 2022 and is expected to become the
stable version in late June, 2022.
# Block external protocol in sandboxed iframes
Sandboxed iframes are not blocked from opening external applications. Currently, developers sandbox untrusted content and block user navigation. Blocking probably should have also included links to external apps or to the Play store. This has now been fixed.
Sites that need navigation can add the following values to the  element&#x27;s sandbox property:
allow-popups
allow-top-navigation
allow-top-navigation-with-user-activation

          <p>CHIPS is a Privacy
Sandbox proposal that introduces a mechanism to opt-in to having third-party
cookies partitioned by top-level site using a new cookie attribute,
Partitioned.
The experiment started in Chrome 100 on March 29, 2022 and was scheduled to run
until June 14, 2022.
To give developers more time to test the feature and gather more feedback, an
extension to the experiment will run through Chrome 104 until the release of Chrome 105, on August 30, 2022.
Starting in version 103, Chrome will include an alternative CHIPS origin trial design for HTTP
cookies, which should enable an opt-in mechanism that will make deployment
easier for large organizations.
In the new design, sending Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Partitioned-Cookies header will
no longer be required to enroll in the origin trial. Sites will only need to
send the Origin-Trial header with their CHIPS origin trial token when they are sending
responses that include the Set-Cookie header with the Partitioned
attribute.
To enroll in the origin trial and start experimenting, head over to
CHIPS origin trial instructions.</p>

Tamagui is the first UI kit for React that has an optimizing compiler - one that not only extracts styles at build-time, but even evaluates inline styles and inline logic like ternaries / conditional spreads. It also flattens components (even those logic-containing ones) completely down to a div or View on Native when possible.
All of this leads to amazing performance gains[1], especially on the web and low-end mobile devices.
I think Tamagui is also really special outside of just the performance. It has an incredibly powerful theme system which you can truly change every aspect of every component through, it supports a &#x60;size&#x60; prop on every component that just works, and it has incredible first-class animation support.

          <p>There are tons of conflicting opinions on the best approach to architecting and designing large scale software. I&#x27;d love to hear some anecdotes for what&#x27;s really worked in the real world.
Bonus points if the pattern was used in a large scale web app with multiple clients and a common backend api.

          <p>I had this question a while ago, trying to understand what is it about that swiping user experience on dating sites that makes them so appealing?
Obviously, the content matters too but I couldn’t get over the fact that just swiping is fun and maybe there is something in there.
To test my hypothesis, I started working on this project couple of weeks ago to see if swiping can increase &quot;survey&quot; engagement. The results were actually great in the sample size that I tested.
Love to hear your thoughts and feedback: https://tuun.app/
Best,

          <p>Just because they’re easy to measure doesn’t mean they matter. If they appear in round numbers and are easily compared to those from others, we’re tempted to compare. But something that looks like a useful metric might not be. If you’re working with people who say they care about measurement, it might not pay to […]</p>

          <p>I know there is no alternative to having actualy experiencing designing and coding software by working at a company like Aamzon or Spotify but if you are stuck at a B2B enterprise company you barely deal with complex challenges at scale and distributed system. At a senior (Staff/Pricipal) level its a deadlock between getting into a roll which does it and learning hands on. Guess &quot;Design a uber&quot; design questions in yourtube is not enough. Any comprehensive resources or habit that can help ?

          <p>Welcome to the start of year edition of &quot;Progress in the Privacy
Sandbox&quot;, covering March and April
2022, as we track the milestones on the path to phasing out third-party cookies
in Chrome and working towards a more private web. In each edition, we share an
overview of the updates to the Privacy Sandbox
timeline
along with news from across the project.
# Privacy Sandbox Relevance and Measurement origin trial
Early developer feedback and the ability to evolve proposals based on that
feedback continues to be a top priority for us. We have opened a combined
origin trial for Attribution Reporting, FLEDGE, and Topics to allow for
initial feedback on these APIs in real world environments.
We&#x27;re starting with a very small proportion of users on the Chrome Beta channel,
starting with Chrome 101. …</p>

          <p>We are thrilled to have the first round of tooling support for the new experimental responsiveness metric, Interaction to Next Paint (INP). To learn about the metric itself, check out the official INP metric guide.
# Suggested measurement
The goal of measuring INP is to understand how fast your page responds to user input. The only way to get realistic data is to measure how your page is responding for real users visiting your site using data from the field.
Measuring INP in the lab then helps to better understand event timings and where optimizations need to happen. Lab tools won&#x27;t automatically interact with the page, so they either need manual input while they measure, or they need to be scripted with an automation tool like Puppeteer. When key interactions are identified from typical u…</p>

          <p>I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:
- forums
- Blogger/Wordpress
- personal portfolio sites
- YouTube for tutorial videos
- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr
- Gumroad for digital products
None of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.
I want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.
Why is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?

          <p>Bootstrap v5.2.0-beta1 added a slew of CSS custom properties, or CSS variables, across the :root level and all our core components. Here’s a quick look at how you can utilize them in your projects.
With CSS variables, you can now customize Bootstrap easier than ever, and without the need for a CSS preprocessor. All the power of Sass is still there behind the scenes, but CSS variables adds a ton of power for the future. Use and compose new values, updates styles globally without recompiling, set fallback values, setup new color modes, and more.
Let’s dig in.
CSS variables?
Their official name is custom properties, but they’re often referred to as CSS variables thanks to their most immediate use case for setting specific values. Consider reading the MDN CSS custom properties article or the C…</p>

          <p>Did you know, if you use CSS math functions like min(), max() and clamp() and you’re calculating any one of the arguments, you don’t need calc()? I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.
So if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);
}
You can do this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);
}
It totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!
It works with custom properties too — check out this demo.
Incidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.</p>

          <p>I realized that I have more respect for the development profession then I do for designers and I am trying to figure out why. Businesses seem to respect both enough to pay large amounts of money for the work, and people out side of the tech space don&#x27;t seem to care either way. I have alternated between the two fields for ~10 years and have ran into UX and Devs who phone it in, and who act like professionals, but the professional craft seems more common in development.

Two years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.
You see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” &#x3D; yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” &#x3D; yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.8.2 has arrvied with some bug fixes and a refreshed docs design to match our main project.
Here’s a quick rundown on the icon fixes:
Fix cutoff bank icon
Fix house-heart and house-heart-fill fill-rules
Fix corners of pentagon icons to match other shapes
Fix fill-rule for x-lg
Fix cutoff tool icon
On the CSS side, we’ve also added font-display: block to help address our icon font affecting Google Lighthouse scores.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

Given the size of the update and time since our last release, we’re doing something different and shipping it as a beta first. Keep reading for details.
Why so long?
I want to start by acknowledging the time it’s taken to ship a new release. As an open source maintainer, I’m constantly worried about not doing or being good enough of a developer for my projects. Pair that with a distributed team all working through this pandemic and me having a heart attack, we’ve all needed some down time. I managed to put together a Bootstrap…</p>

          <p>According to Toshi Omagari, the author of Arcade Game Typography, the world’s first multi-colored digital font was created in 1982 for a never-released video game called Insector. Multi-colored fonts, sometimes called chromatic type, are still relatively rare on the …

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/private-prefetch-proxy/ target="_blank">Private prefetch proxy in Chrome</a>
          <p>Since Chrome 92, we&#x27;ve been running an Early Access Program (EAP) for a feature called Private Prefetch Proxy, which speeds up outgoing navigations from Google Search by 30% at the median. Private Prefetch Proxy allows the prefetching of cross-origin content without exposing user information to the destination website until the user navigates. We expect that the feature will graduate from this EAP as early as Chrome 103, thereby no longer requiring websites to opt-in, and allowing other referrer websites to safely speed up cross-site navigations.
Read on to learn about how this feature works,
how it can help significantly improve your sites&#x27; Largest Contentful Paint (LCP),
or how referrer websites can help their users achieve their goals by speeding up cross-site navigations.

          <p># Why does page load speed matter?
Most users routinely identify slow page loads as a major source of frustration (54% in a user study conducted by Google). So, it should not come as a surprise that faster page loads result in better outcomes for a business. Indeed, if visitors get frustrated even before they interact with a website, it&#x27;s very unlikely that they will stay long enough to appreciate its value. In fact, another Google study across 254 eCommerce, finance, and travel sites showed that sites which load in two seconds or less had 15% higher conversion rates.

As the saying goes, you can&#x27;t improve what you don&#x27;t measure. For user experiences on the web, we believe that Core Web Vitals constitute a solid set of user-centric metrics design…</p>

We have, and have always had, all the time there is.” *** Despite having been published in 1910, Arnold Bennett’s book How to Live on 24 Hours a Day remains a valuable resource on living a meaningful life within the constraints of time.

# Preview feature: New Performance insights panel
Use the Performance insights panel to get actionable and use-case-driven insights on your website&#x27;s performance.
Open the panel and start a new recording based on your use case. For example, let’s measure the page load of this demo page.
Once the recording is complete, you get the performance insights on the  Insights pane. Click on each insight item (for example, Render blocking request, layout shift) to understand the issue and potential fixes.
Go to the Performance insights panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial.

At Chrome Dev Summit 2020, we demoed Chrome&#x27;s debugging support for WebAssembly applications on the web for the first time. Since then, the team has invested a lot of energy into making the developer experience scale for large and even huge applications. In this post we will show you the knobs we added (or made work) in the different tools and how to use them!
# Scalable debugging
Let&#x27;s pick up where we left off in our 2020 post. Here is the example we were looking at back then:
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  // Init SDL.
  int width &#x3D; 600, height &#x3D; 600;
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
  SDL_Window* window;
  SDL_Renderer* renderer;

          <p>I&#x27;ve finally become proficient with Tailwind CSS.
However, my sites still look ok. I&#x27;ve adopted the idea of &quot;use different shades gray to make UIs&quot; and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.
Consider sites like:
- https://curius.app/
- https://www.notion.so/
- https://www.focusmate.com/
These sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn&#x27;t help me make my site look... human.
I feel like I need a &quot;design palette&quot; instead of a mere &quot;color/margin palette&quot;. What&#x27;s the recommendation for this?

          <p>One of the things we want to do when trying to make our websites faster is to have content appear on screen as quickly as possible. It’s something that metrics such as First and Largest Contentful Paint try to measure.
To achieve faster paint times, we often want to try and prioritise content requests like fonts and images. While we can do a lot by ourselves to optimise these resources, there are times when even our best efforts can sometimes be undone by third-party requests that block the browser from rendering content.
In this post, we’ll cover:
What are render-blocking resources?
How can render-blocking third-party requests hurt a site’s performance?

          <p>One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.
Take color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.

The rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.
In design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel…</p>

          <p>The web platform now ships with Capture Handle, a mechanism that helps collaboration between capturing and captured web apps. Capture Handle allows a capturing web app to ergonomically and confidently identify the captured web app. (If the captured web app has opted-in.)
A few examples illustrate the benefits.
Example 1: If a video conferencing web app is capturing a presentation web app, the video conferencing web app can expose controls to the user for navigating between slides. Because the controls are embedded directly in the video conferencing web app, the user doesn’t have to repeatedly switch between the video conferencing tab and the presented tab. With this burden lifted, the user is now free to concentrate more fully on the delivery of their presentation.

The web is now more capable than ever, enabling developers to bring to the web highly capable applications such as Photoshop.
Though the Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, we&#x27;re responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend on countless others in the community who have built a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools, demonstration apps, and other materials. To help recognize the importance of this work and to enable more people to spend time on these projects, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce today the launch of the Advanced Web Apps Fund: a new fund to support the web a…</p>

          <p>Some situations seem to call for an opponent. It might be our personality, the structure of the engagement or the way we’ve been taught to behave, but having an enemy seems to focus individuals and groups. For fifty years, America decided that the USSR was the enemy, and spent a great deal of time and […]</p>

          <p>Hey,
this week’s links are quite interesting: A couple of web standard (proposals) that would make CSS easier again like CSS Toggles, easy progressive enhancement for form data using the web platform. But also things like a huge list of JavaScript concepts to enhance your knowledge, or simple multi-select fields without a UI library. And then, self-hosted apps seem to become more popular again as rally or planby, two open source planning/meeting/schedule tools show us. It’s always fun to collect the links for my newsletter and shows how diverse web development is. And finally, the tips from Kevin Kelly on how to see and live life are a great inspiration to become a calmer, nicer and more focused person valued in a community.

          <p>Hi all,
(I hope I&#x27;m posting this in the right place)
I&#x27;m trying to make my website as secure as possible.
Does the PHP function htmlspecialchars() prevent against XSS attacks when providing user supplied data to a HTML attribute?
Is it possible for the encoded characters from htmlspecialchars() to be used to perform an XSS attack?
For example: 
(The user can supply alt text for an image)
window.alert(&#x27;Something Bad&#x27;);&quot;&gt;
Thanks.

          <p>April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.
A new lawn

My wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.

          <p>These days, almost every company is a design company, but the need for qualified designers far exceeds the supply. To fill this gap, companies of all sizes are embracing no-design tools that let non-designers participate in the design process.
With no-design tools, collaboration between non-designers and designers becomes exponentially more productive and powerful. In fact, many would argue that the no-design movement — twin to the no-code movement — is essential for shaping the future of work.
Think about it: Would you rather receive an interactive mockup or a cryptic PowerPoint deck on what your client or colleague wants you to design?

The hwb() color notation gives you a new way to specify color according to hue, whiteness, and blackness.
Priority Hints give you a way to hint to the browser in which order resources should be downloaded.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
Let&#x27;s take a look at what&#x27;s available in Chrome 101.
# hwb() color notation
Described in an article by Stefan Judis as a &quot;color notation for humans&quot;, hwb() specifies color according to hue, whiteness, and blackness. As with other color notations, an optional alpha component specifies opacity.
h1 {
  color: hwb(194 0% 0% / .5) /* #00c3ff with 50% opacity */
}
This method of specifying color is now well-supported, with Firefox supporting it from version 96, and Safari from version 15.

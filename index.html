          <p>I’ve been making art and putting it on the internet for 20 years or so. I’ve used:
- forums
- Blogger/Wordpress
- personal portfolio sites
- YouTube for tutorial videos
- FB/Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr
- Gumroad for digital products
None of these outlets feels like a good “home” to me. Forums were great for WIP feedback but the good ones all died and got hacked. Blogs and my personal sites have always been good, but discoverability isn’t there. Social media platforms gave me a little more visibility, but lock-in and platform culture are extremely toxic. Instagram, for example, is touted as THE social media platform for artists, but the way they process image uploads is awful. The promotion or burying of posts is opaque.
I want to create my work and put it where people might have a chance of seeing it, without algorithmic shenanigans or dark patterns.
Why is this so difficult? How would you approach solving this?

          <p>Did you know, if you use CSS math functions like min(), max() and clamp() and you’re calculating any one of the arguments, you don’t need calc()? I think it was Ahmad Shadeed who mentioned this on Twitter the other day, but I could be wrong.
So if you want to use clamp() for some fluid typography, say, with a calc() function for the middle value, instead of doing this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, calc(1rem + 3vw), 4rem);
}
You can do this:
h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 1rem + 3vw, 4rem);
}
It totally makes sense, because min(), max() and clamp() already are math functions. But nonetheless, it’s something I wasn’t aware of before!
It works with custom properties too — check out this demo.
Incidentally, if you want to know more about fluid typography in CSS (including accessibility concerns), this comprehensive guide by Adrian Bece has you covered.</p>

          <p>I realized that I have more respect for the development profession then I do for designers and I am trying to figure out why. Businesses seem to respect both enough to pay large amounts of money for the work, and people out side of the tech space don&#x27;t seem to care either way. I have alternated between the two fields for ~10 years and have ran into UX and Devs who phone it in, and who act like professionals, but the professional craft seems more common in development.

Two years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.
You see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” &#x3D; yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” &#x3D; yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.8.2 has arrvied with some bug fixes and a refreshed docs design to match our main project.
Here’s a quick rundown on the icon fixes:
Fix cutoff bank icon
Fix house-heart and house-heart-fill fill-rules
Fix corners of pentagon icons to match other shapes
Fix fill-rule for x-lg
Fix cutoff tool icon
On the CSS side, we’ve also added font-display: block to help address our icon font affecting Google Lighthouse scores.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

          <p>It’s the biggest release since v5 itself—Bootstrap v5.2.0-beta1 is here! This release features redesigned docs, CSS variables for all our components, responsive offcanvas, new helpers and utilities, refined buttons and inputs, and lots of improvements under the hood.
Given the size of the update and time since our last release, we’re doing something different and shipping it as a beta first. Keep reading for details.
Why so long?
I want to start by acknowledging the time it’s taken to ship a new release. As an open source maintainer, I’m constantly worried about not doing or being good enough of a developer for my projects. Pair that with a distributed team all working through this pandemic and me having a heart attack, we’ve all needed some down time. I managed to put together a Bootstrap…</p>

          <p>This is a great excuse for racing to the bottom. Corporations with power go ahead and take advantage of customers. “Well, if we don’t do it, a competitor will.” The public markets don’t require companies to throw out their principles to succeed. In fact, they reward companies that do the opposite. People exploit vulnerabilities in […]</p>

          <a href=https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/private-prefetch-proxy/ target="_blank">Private prefetch proxy in Chrome</a>
          <p>Since Chrome 92, we&#x27;ve been running an Early Access Program (EAP) for a feature called Private Prefetch Proxy, which speeds up outgoing navigations from Google Search by 30% at the median. Private Prefetch Proxy allows the prefetching of cross-origin content without exposing user information to the destination website until the user navigates. We expect that the feature will graduate from this EAP as early as Chrome 103, thereby no longer requiring websites to opt-in, and allowing other referrer websites to safely speed up cross-site navigations.
Read on to learn about how this feature works,
how it can help significantly improve your sites&#x27; Largest Contentful Paint (LCP),
or how referrer websites can help their users achieve their goals by speeding up cross-site navigations.

          <p># Why does page load speed matter?
Most users routinely identify slow page loads as a major source of frustration (54% in a user study conducted by Google). So, it should not come as a surprise that faster page loads result in better outcomes for a business. Indeed, if visitors get frustrated even before they interact with a website, it&#x27;s very unlikely that they will stay long enough to appreciate its value. In fact, another Google study across 254 eCommerce, finance, and travel sites showed that sites which load in two seconds or less had 15% higher conversion rates.

As the saying goes, you can&#x27;t improve what you don&#x27;t measure. For user experiences on the web, we believe that Core Web Vitals constitute a solid set of user-centric metrics design…</p>

          <p>“We shall never have more time. We have, and have always had, all the time there is.” *** Despite having been published in 1910, Arnold Bennett’s book How to Live on 24 Hours a Day remains a valuable resource on living a meaningful life within the constraints of time. In the book, Bennett addresses one …

Have you ever considered using SVG’s internal coordinate system to create a responsive image grid, for example, or adding texture to an SVG?

# Preview feature: New Performance insights panel
Use the Performance insights panel to get actionable and use-case-driven insights on your website&#x27;s performance.
Open the panel and start a new recording based on your use case. For example, let’s measure the page load of this demo page.
Once the recording is complete, you get the performance insights on the  Insights pane. Click on each insight item (for example, Render blocking request, layout shift) to understand the issue and potential fixes.
Go to the Performance insights panel documentation to learn more with the step-by-step tutorial.

At Chrome Dev Summit 2020, we demoed Chrome&#x27;s debugging support for WebAssembly applications on the web for the first time. Since then, the team has invested a lot of energy into making the developer experience scale for large and even huge applications. In this post we will show you the knobs we added (or made work) in the different tools and how to use them!
# Scalable debugging
Let&#x27;s pick up where we left off in our 2020 post. Here is the example we were looking at back then:
#include 
#include 
int main() {
  // Init SDL.
  int width &#x3D; 600, height &#x3D; 600;
  SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO);
  SDL_Window* window;
  SDL_Renderer* renderer;

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31317653 target="_blank">Ask HN: Design palettes instead of color palettes?</a>
          <p>I&#x27;ve finally become proficient with Tailwind CSS.
However, my sites still look ok. I&#x27;ve adopted the idea of &quot;use different shades gray to make UIs&quot; and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.
Consider sites like:
- https://curius.app/
- https://www.notion.so/
- https://www.focusmate.com/
These sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn&#x27;t help me make my site look... human.
I feel like I need a &quot;design palette&quot; instead of a mere &quot;color/margin palette&quot;. What&#x27;s the recommendation for this?

          <p>One of the things we want to do when trying to make our websites faster is to have content appear on screen as quickly as possible. It’s something that metrics such as First and Largest Contentful Paint try to measure.
To achieve faster paint times, we often want to try and prioritise content requests like fonts and images. While we can do a lot by ourselves to optimise these resources, there are times when even our best efforts can sometimes be undone by third-party requests that block the browser from rendering content.
In this post, we’ll cover:
What are render-blocking resources?
How can render-blocking third-party requests hurt a site’s performance?

          <p>One principle I’ve come to embrace is that the answer is rarely ever a spectrum. At first glance, a single-axis spectrum might make perfect sense, a reduction of the problem, a right and a left, a binary dichotomy but with a grey area in the middle. But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.
Take color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.

The rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover. All the hues of visible light rolled into one gradient stripe.
In design tools the different hues are often represented in a 360º color wheel…</p>

          <p>The web platform now ships with Capture Handle, a mechanism that helps collaboration between capturing and captured web apps. Capture Handle allows a capturing web app to ergonomically and confidently identify the captured web app. (If the captured web app has opted-in.)
A few examples illustrate the benefits.
Example 1: If a video conferencing web app is capturing a presentation web app, the video conferencing web app can expose controls to the user for navigating between slides. Because the controls are embedded directly in the video conferencing web app, the user doesn’t have to repeatedly switch between the video conferencing tab and the presented tab. With this burden lifted, the user is now free to concentrate more fully on the delivery of their presentation.

The web is now more capable than ever, enabling developers to bring to the web highly capable applications such as Photoshop.
Though the Chrome team has been working hard to build new capabilities, we&#x27;re responsible for only a small fraction of the work. Web app developers depend on countless others in the community who have built a strong ecosystem of APIs, tools, demonstration apps, and other materials. To help recognize the importance of this work and to enable more people to spend time on these projects, we&#x27;re thrilled to announce today the launch of the Advanced Web Apps Fund: a new fund to support the web a…</p>

          <p>Some situations seem to call for an opponent. It might be our personality, the structure of the engagement or the way we’ve been taught to behave, but having an enemy seems to focus individuals and groups. For fifty years, America decided that the USSR was the enemy, and spent a great deal of time and […]</p>

          <p>Hey,
this week’s links are quite interesting: A couple of web standard (proposals) that would make CSS easier again like CSS Toggles, easy progressive enhancement for form data using the web platform. But also things like a huge list of JavaScript concepts to enhance your knowledge, or simple multi-select fields without a UI library. And then, self-hosted apps seem to become more popular again as rally or planby, two open source planning/meeting/schedule tools show us. It’s always fun to collect the links for my newsletter and shows how diverse web development is. And finally, the tips from Kevin Kelly on how to see and live life are a great inspiration to become a calmer, nicer and more focused person valued in a community.

          <p>Hi all,
(I hope I&#x27;m posting this in the right place)
I&#x27;m trying to make my website as secure as possible.
Does the PHP function htmlspecialchars() prevent against XSS attacks when providing user supplied data to a HTML attribute?
Is it possible for the encoded characters from htmlspecialchars() to be used to perform an XSS attack?
For example: 
(The user can supply alt text for an image)
window.alert(&#x27;Something Bad&#x27;);&quot;&gt;
Thanks.

          <p>April was a busy month of new happenings and finishing projects. I did a new workshop, we got a new lawn, my kids are learning new skills, my wife got a new (short term) job, new developments at my new company, a new blog design, and to cap it all off I turned a new age number which is for sure what people call having a birthday.
A new lawn

My wife and I have wanted to redo the yard for awhile now. In Austin it’s hard to find people to do the work. We even offered someone an obscene amount of money to help us and they didn’t even call us back. Then our neighbor Jim said he was getting his bushes replaced by a guy named José. We asked José, not expecting to hear back, and he said he could start that week.

          <p>These days, almost every company is a design company, but the need for qualified designers far exceeds the supply. To fill this gap, companies of all sizes are embracing no-design tools that let non-designers participate in the design process.
With no-design tools, collaboration between non-designers and designers becomes exponentially more productive and powerful. In fact, many would argue that the no-design movement — twin to the no-code movement — is essential for shaping the future of work.
Think about it: Would you rather receive an interactive mockup or a cryptic PowerPoint deck on what your client or colleague wants you to design? How much quicker can you get to the final version if you have a visual representation of what you’re aiming for from the get-go? How much back and forth c…</p>

The hwb() color notation gives you a new way to specify color according to hue, whiteness, and blackness.
Priority Hints give you a way to hint to the browser in which order resources should be downloaded.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
Let&#x27;s take a look at what&#x27;s available in Chrome 101.
# hwb() color notation
Described in an article by Stefan Judis as a &quot;color notation for humans&quot;, hwb() specifies color according to hue, whiteness, and blackness. As with other color notations, an optional alpha component specifies opacity.
h1 {
  color: hwb(194 0% 0% / .5) /* #00c3ff with 50% opacity */
}
This method of specifying color is now well-supported, with Firefox supporting it from version 96, and Safari from version 15.

          <p>As I’ve written about recently, it’s super exciting to see a bunch of new CSS features landing in browsers, and who can blame us for wanting to get started using them straight away?! It’s great to see browsers working to support new CSS features quicker than ever before, and that pace should persist with Interop, an initiative where browser vendors work together to implement features interoperably. And with so-called “evergreen” browsers, most users should see those new features right away, as their browsers update seamlessly.
But, as Jim Neilsen pointed out, that doesn’t mean every user has the latest and greatest browser version. Many older devices can’t update to the latest version. The OS doesn’t support it. This means that:
You need to test your website on older devices, and

          <p>The inert property is a global HTML attribute that simplifies how to remove and restore user input events for an element, including focus events and events from assistive technologies.
Inert is a default behavior in dialog elements, such as when you use showModal to open a dialog for users to make a selection and then dismiss it from the screen. In new browser versions, the inert attribute is available to bring similar accessible experiences to custom UI elements and interactions more granularly.
In Chromium 102, inert is available by default for developers.
Inert means lacking the ability to move, so when you mark something inert, you remove movement or interaction from those DOM elements.

          <p>Collapsing content sections, sometimes described as an accordion, are a common UI pattern. However, content hidden in the collapsed sections becomes impossible to search using a find-in-page search. Also, it isn&#x27;t possible to link to text fragments inside collapsed regions.
The hidden&#x3D;until-found HTML attribute and beforematch event can solve these problems. By adding hidden&#x3D;until-found to the container for your hidden content, you make it possible for the browser to search text in that hidden region, and reveal the section if a match is found.
In addition to allowing find-in-page search on hidden regions, this feature will allow this hidden content to be accessible to search engines. Google Search will even form links that scroll to the revealed fragment.
These features are available from…</p>

This is similar to how Google tracks their search results.
Why such a privacy oriented search engine implemented this, is beyond me.

          <p>If you’re a freelance designer or creative entrepreneur, you may have heard the word “cybersecurity” buzzing around a lot lately—especially in the last two years as more businesses lean into the digital world and online tools. But with new changes come new opportunities, both for businesses and cybercriminals.
Let’s dive into what cybersecurity really means and how you can use it to protect your business — whether you’re a freelance designer or a growing creative agency.

          <p>I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.

My favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.
The circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.
Sometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.
To top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.
Whatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.</p>

          <p>What seems like only a few months ago, I wrote about being diagnosed with MS, and yet that was over 2 years ago (and the diagnosis was actually December 2019).
As it&#x27;s MS Awareness Week 2022 and MS was on my mind (literally and figuratively!) I thought an update blog post would seem fit.
My post in 2020 started stating this, which, as it turns out, wasn&#x27;t right at all:

I was diagnosed with &quot;very mild benign relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&quot;.</p>

          <p>Howdy! If you frequent this website often, you’ll notice some changes. This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.
~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.
Without further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…

          <p>I&#x27;ve been a backend developer for a while. My team has been sending me frontend PRs lately. I find it hard to see visual changes before and after a PR request. This is for UI changes, not for logic changes. Is there any tool that can make this smoother?

          <p>The Capabilities Project (code name Project Fugu) is a cross-company effort with
the objective of making it possible for web apps to do anything platform-specific apps can. We
enable amazing web applications like Photoshop by exposing the capabilities of
the underlying operating system platforms to the web platform, while maintaining user security,
privacy, trust, and other core tenets of the web.
But what are examples of some of the apps that make use of these capabilities? The Project Fugu API
Showcase embedded below is sourced by community submissions and contains a filterable list of apps
that make use of one or more APIs that were developed in the context of the project. You can propose
missing apps by submitting them via an
anonymous form.
Submissions are reviewed on a regular basis and the showcase will be updated accordingly.
You can launch each app by clicking the app&#x27;s name, the app&#x27;s preview image, or the Launch app
link. For many apps, you can also see the source code by clicking Source code. On supporting
browsers, you can share any of the listed apps via the Share app feature. As a special inception
Easter egg, the Project Fugu API Showcase is of course
contained
in the Project Fugu API Showcase. Happy browsing!</p>

          <p>Over the last decade, identity federation has played a central role in
raising the bar for authentication on the web, in terms of ease-of-use (such
as password-less single sign-in), security (such as improved resistance to
phishing and credential stuffing attacks) and trustworthiness compared to
per-site usernames and passwords. With identity federation, a RP (relying
party) relies on an IDP (identity provider) to provide the user an account
without requiring a new username and password.

Key Term
Identity federation delegates authentication or authorization of an
individual (user or entity) to a trusted external party (an identity
provider or IdP). The identity provider then allows the individual to sign in
to a website (a relying party or RP).
Unfortunately, the mechanisms that identity …</p>

          <p>I am using FeedBro, it&#x27;s a browser extension and it does not sync data yet. So I just export my subscriptions to a OPML file as a backup. It&#x27;s free and has some nice features.
For other feeds I use iNoReader which is really packed with all kinds of features.

After watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?

Does anyone remember what this was? Or have examples of websites that are similar?

          <p>Signed exchanges (SXGs) are a means to improve your page speed—mainly Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). When referring sites (currently Google Search) link to a page, they can prefetch it into the browser cache before the user clicks on the link.
It&#x27;s possible to make web pages that, when prefetched, require no network on the critical path to rendering the page! On a 4G connection, this page load goes from 6s to 0.9s (the remaining 0.9s being mostly by CPU usage):
          

Most people publishing SXGs today are using Cloudflare&#x27;s easy-to-use Automatic Signed Exchanges (ASX) feature (though open source options exist too):
In many cases, checking the box to enable this feature is enough to get the kind of substantial improvement shown above. Sometimes, there are a few more steps to ensure th…</p>

          <p>This was a talk given at the Eleventy Meetup (11tymeetup.dev). While it was originally titled a “State of 11ty” talk, it somehow got laser-focused on differentiating between the Eleventy rendering modes: Build, Serverless, and Edge.
Video pending. I’ll link up the video here when it’s added to the Eleventy Meetup YouTube channel.

          <p>There exists a lot of high-quality UI component libraries such as MUI, Bootstrap, ANT, Grommet, Chakra, Semantic UI, etc. These components typically map to primitive types:
    boolean -&gt; checkbox / toggle button / visibility
    integer -&gt; numeric input / slider
    enum -&gt; drop down menu / radio buttons
    string -&gt; text field
    date -&gt; date picker
    array -&gt; list view
    matrix -&gt; table view
    bitmap -&gt; image
    async promise -&gt; loading indicator
    side effect -&gt; button

Have I been searching in the wrong place or do such higher-level UI component libraries actually don&#x27;t exist?

            >Today, the distant future</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.
Still, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.
In 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.
It all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># Introduction
Chrome is deprecating direct access to private network endpoints from public
websites as part of the
Private Network Access (PNA)
specification.
Chrome will start sending a CORS preflight request ahead of any private
network request for a subresource, which asks
for explicit permission from the target server. This preflight request will
carry a new header, Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true, and the
response to it must carry a corresponding header,
Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true.
The aim is to protect users from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
targeting routers and other devices on private networks. These attacks have
affected hundreds of thousands of users,
allowing attackers to redirect them to malicious servers.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Compact, compression-friendly, color vector fonts with all your favorite
gradient flavors.
In Chrome 98, the Chrome and Fonts teams have added support for COLRv1, an
evolution of the COLRv0 font format intended to make color fonts widespread by
adding gradients, compositing and blending, and improved internal shape reuse
for crisp and compact font files that compress well.
Examples in this blog post require a browser that supports
COLRv1 fonts. Try viewing this post in Chrome 98 or above.
# Color now
On the web, text is generally drawn in a color specified in CSS. The font does
not define any particular color, it just indicates where pixels should be
placed. That&#x27;s usually a good thing. CSS lets the author flexibly choose a
color. However, sometimes a glyph contains multiple colors that to…</p>

            >It&#x27;s not a lottery</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there&#x27;s already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I&#x27;m just left thinking: What&#x27;s the point? Do people think this is a lottery?
This isn&#x27;t unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don&#x27;t even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?
Maybe that&#x27;s part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don&#x27;t even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I&#x27;m skeptical.
Either way, it&#x27;s not how we review applications at Basecamp. There&#x27;s a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don&#x27;t comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a &quot;manager of managers&quot; for the director of engineering).
You might think, what&#x27;s the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that&#x27;s it. But I think there&#x27;s a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I&#x27;m not getting callbacks, so I&#x27;ll put even less effort into the next opening.
I guess what I&#x27;m saying is make the effort or don&#x27;t bother. We&#x27;re not drawing names out of a hat here.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We just opened a position for a Director of Engineering to help us manage our rapidly expanding technical teams at Basecamp. We already have more programmers on staff than we&#x27;ve ever had, and we intend to double that crew within the next 12-18 months. We&#x27;re going all-in on becoming a multi-product business again, and that means hiring the managers needed to to cope with those ambitions.
Not just because of this rapid growth on the technical teams, but because the rest of the company is growing along with it. We&#x27;ll be bigger than we&#x27;ve ever been this January, and before the end of the year, we&#x27;ll be much bigger still. Wild to think that after almost twenty years in business, we&#x27;re suddenly on a fast track to crack a hundred employees.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team&#x27;s work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what&#x27;s happening across the company.
The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it&#x27;s a book, it&#x27;s obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn&#x27;t like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let&#x27;s look at something that was posted internally, today.

what this post is
The following is an incomplete draft, which I&#x27;m publishing now because I am unlikely to ever finish writing it.
I no longer fully endorse all the claims in the post.  (In a few cases, I&#x27;ve added a note to say this explicitly.)  However, there are some arguments in the post that I still endorse, and which I have not seen made elsewhere.
This post is the result of me having lots of opinions about LM scaling, at various times in 2021, which were difficult to write down briefly or independently of one another.  This post, originally written in July 2021, is the closest I got to writing them all down in one place.

            >Faith in eventually</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.

During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.

There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.

It’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.

This is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.

Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it&#x27;s never right even after.

In the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last week, I wrote an article for CSS Tricks on the one thing I wish everyone would do to make the web better in 2022.
 One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you don’t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.</p>

            >It could be worse</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I grew up with persistent reminders of how any bad thing that happened could easily have been worse. Oh, you scraped your knee? It could be worse, you could have broken your leg! Oh, you broke your leg? It could be worse, you could have cracked your skull! Oh, you cracked your skull? It could be worse, you could have died!
It wasn&#x27;t just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control. The way to make those setbacks and the inevitable suffering in life bearable was to constantly remind yourself that... it could be worse!
Any student of Stoicism will recognize this pattern of mental fortification. It&#x27;s closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality. And the ultimate resilience to face the struggles of living lies in controlling our reactions to the things that happen. Our reactions are not given. They can be changed.
I wish there was more of that today. More &quot;it could be worse&quot;. Less &quot;this is the worst thing ever&quot;.</p>

When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us.

One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or…</p>

Whenever someone writes and shares one of these year-end retrospectives the result is, by its very nature, personal. These last two years are different though. We all still have our own personal perspectives, but we also all share a collective experience of The Ongoing Situation.
Like, I can point to three pivotal events in 2021 and I bet you could point to the same three for you:
getting my first vaccine shot in March,
getting my second vaccine shot in June, and
getting my booster shot in December.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It was a very loud year, 2021. Which makes the satisfying silence of technical incidents at Basecamp all the more of a celebration. In the year that went, every single application we offer had at least 99.99% uptime! This is through repeated AWS outages, zero-day security alerts, and the drama of the world in those twelve months.
But it gets better. Basecamp 3 had an uptime of 99.997%. HEY pipped it by a point with 99.998% uptime. And Basecamp 2 hit the mythical five nines with 99.999% uptime! I believe that is the best reliability record we&#x27;ve ever achieved for a full year in our almost twenty year history as a software company. Worth a toast!
It&#x27;s the result of years of investments in things like active-active double data center deployments for our on-premise apps like Basecamp 2 and 3. …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 14, 2021 8:09 PM GMT

ARC has published a report on Eliciting Latent Knowledge, an open problem which we believe is central to alignment. We think reading this report is the clearest way to understand what problems we are working on, how they fit into our plan for solving alignment in the worst case, and our research methodology.
The core difficulty we discuss is learning how to map between an AI’s model of the world and a human’s model. This is closely related to ontology identification (and other similar statements). Our main contribution is to present many possible approaches to the problem and a more precise discussion of why it seems to be difficult and important.
The report is available here as a google document. If you&#x27;re excited about this research, we&#x27;re hiring!
Q&amp;A
We&#x27;re particularly excited about answering questions posted here throughout December. We welcome any questions no matter how basic or confused; we would love to help people understand what research we’re doing and how we evaluate progress in enough detail that they could start to do it themselves.
Thanks to María Gutiérrez-Rojas for the illustrations in this piece (the good ones, blame us for the ugly diagrams). Thanks to Buck Shlegeris, Jon Uesato, Carl Shulman, and especially Holden Karnofsky for helpful discussions and comments.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">&quot;Winning&quot; – the word has a multitude of meanings. 


To some, it may mean to be at the top in every sense, ahead of everyone; and to some, it may mean chasing perfection.  


But what happens when you reach the “pinnacle” of Success? 


How do you stay a winner when you’re already at the top, and there’s nowhere else to go? How do you maintain that winning streak that syncs your flow through life? And most importantly how do you reap the possibilities created through ‘The Winning’?


“You and your organization, are most vulnerable when you are most successful.” – Robin Sharma, The Greatness Guide 


A real win is when you truly feel happy from within, and not vulnerable – Which can only happen when you can ‘Stop Worrying and Start Living.’

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">As my year in reading goes, I&#x27;ve certainly read less books, but I&#x27;ve not spent less time reading. It&#x27;s just some books take me longer than others. For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it&#x27;s really swings and roundabouts.
I recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn&#x27;t count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.
This post is mostly data driven (from my own web site&#x27;s data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I&#x27;ve read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On the face of it, this seems like a basic medical question. One where reasonable people can weigh the same trade offs, yet arrive at different conclusions. And, as foreign as that might seem to Americans at the moment, that&#x27;s largely how this question has been tackled in Denmark in the public forum so far.
There are Danish pediatricians arguing that the determining factor should be that kids themselves don&#x27;t stand to benefit much from the vaccine. That the Danish principle on vaccines has up until this point weighed protecting the vaccinated themselves as the number one goal. And thus Denmark should not recommend the vaccine for kids broadly.
Then there are the health authorities saying that regardless of whether the vaccines are likely to help the individual kid, it&#x27;s important that they…</p>

CSS
There hasn’t been one single new CSS feature in 2021 that’s captured my attention above all others. But CSS continues to evolve and keep pace with developers’ needs. It’s great to see browsers coming through with widespread support for aspect-ratio. I’ve been using min(), max() and clamp() a lot more now that they’re widely supported, and finding them super convenient. And there are a lot of exciting new CSS features just over the horizon — some of which browsers are already beginning to implement. Her…</p>

The mantra for the year was “No goals, only vibes” and while that’s non-commital, I like to think I operated in this spirit. I wandered aimlessly and found some good vibes to mine.
Some highlights include:

😃 Paid off our car!

😢 Lost my grandma Joyce

End of year celebrations, wrapping up work projects, wrapping up presents, another round of last minute shopping, credit card charges ballooning, decorating projects, transcontinental road-trips, shipping logistics, finding a dog sitter, dog sitter falling through, what about the sick cat, where’s the iPad charger, eating hundreds of cookies, getting sick, advent calendars, anxious kids pondering presents under trees.
But we made it.
The minute we finished building the kids’ trampoline and my work obligations spun down, my immune system collapsed. Apparently “let down” is a real thing where you get sick on holidays because your body was hanging on by a thread while obligations remained.

Elsewhere in 2021 I published two seasons of the Clearleft podcast (12 episodes), and I wrote the 15 modules that comprise a course on responsive design on web.dev.
Most of my speaking engagements in 2021 were online though I did manage a little bit of travel in between COVID waves.
My travel map for the year includes one transatlantic trip: Christmas in Arizona, where I’m writing this end-of-year wrap-up before getting back on a plane to England tomorrow, Omicron willing.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I read 26 books in 2021, which is a bit more than I read in 2020. That said, some of them were brief books. I don’t think I actually read any more than my usual annual allotment of words.
I’m glad that I’m tracking my reading here on my own site. About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.
I continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.
Now that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…</p>

            >Does it make you enjoy?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">My friend and I have been discussing cars.
He&#x27;s thinking of buying his first fancy one.
His dad had one years ago, and he&#x27;s thought about buying a car like this — like his dad&#x27;s — for years. He&#x27;s stressed over it, he&#x27;s agonized over it, and he&#x27;s spent a few too many hours thinking about all the reasons why and why not.
This morning he told me he was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t make him happy.
Of course it won&#x27;t, I said. But that&#x27;s the wrong question.
The better question is &quot;Will I enjoy it?&quot;
Making you happy is too high a bar for anything. It&#x27;s unfair to ask that of anyone or anything — it&#x27;s something you can really only ask yourself, or bring yourself.
But enjoying something? That&#x27;s possible! It&#x27;s very much within reach.
So I said, will you enjoy the car? Could you see yourself enjoying the car? Will you enjoy the drive?
And that&#x27;s a much easier question to answer. And an expectation that&#x27;s easier to accept.
Objects (and experiences) don&#x27;t make you anything, you have to enjoy them.
Enjoying something is plenty.
I think he&#x27;s going to buy one.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 28, 2021 5:10 PM GMT

A year and a half ago, I wrote a post called Covid-19: My Current Model. Since then things have often changed, and we have learned a lot. It seems like high time for a new post of this type.
Note that this post mostly does not justify and explain its statements. I document my thinking, sources and analysis extensively elsewhere, little of this should be new.
This post combines the basic principles from my original post, which mostly still stand, with my core model for Omicron. I’ll summarize and update the first post, then share my current principles for Omicron and how to deal with and think about it.
There’s a lot of different things going on, so this will likely be incomplete, but hopefully it will prove useful. The personally useful executive…</p>

            >A Psalm for the Wild-Built (Monk &amp; Robot, #1) [book]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.
Only right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn&#x27;t the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of &quot;millennium type problems&quot;. Using air quotes in my description because I&#x27;m fairly sure this is a patronising statement I&#x27;m making!
The Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they&#x27;re left feeling empty. Obviously it&#x27;s an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.
For me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I&#x27;ve already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex&#x27;s personality).
But what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, so Chamber&#x27;s settles with using the &quot;they&quot; pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.
The sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with &quot;it&quot; and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is &quot;they&quot;. This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn&#x27;t happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber&#x27;s wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.
I do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won&#x27;t cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.</p>

What makes you think that? It&#x27;s possible that your circumstances and mindset were holding you back.


In fact, our mindset accounts for 80% of our success and mechanics and circumstances account for 20%. Most people know enough to get the job done, but they don&#x27;t because their psychology is out of sync with their objectives.


You can&#x27;t guarantee success, but you can improve your chances. After all, chance favors the prepared. Here I am sharing 6 ways to increase the odds of success.

            >Ask HN: Is there a proper design pattern for this situation?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software&#x27;s API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.
I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I&#x27;m certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I&#x27;d like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.
The problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don&#x27;t see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.
In a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that&#x27;s not an option.
Is my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?

But the calculation for converting sRGB colors to HSL colors sets the hue value to NaN [1]. Why? If I can&#x27;t trust the standard to be correct, then what can I trust?

            >:has() Has Landed in Safari</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:
section:has(img) {
  background: lightgray;
}
But eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.
You could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:
form:has(input:invalid) {
  border: 2px solid red;
}
The parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.
It’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():
@supports selector(:has(*)) {
  .info,
  .warning {
    display: none;
  }
}
On a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Replacing a substring of text within a larger string has always been misleading in JavaScript. I wrote Replace All Occurrences of a String in JavaScript years ago and it’s still one of my most read articles. The confusion lies in that replace only replaces the first occurrence of a substring, not all occurrences. For example: […]

This year has been challenging for many. For me, it definitely was. Thankfully, I made a very good decision three years ago that enables me to be outside in nature most of the days. It helps me a lot dealing with the many challenges that are in everyone’s heads right now. Especially now as a father of a young child, it’s not always easy to stay positive, to not be stressed out or discuss, talk about certain topics all the time.

The &quot;biological anchors&quot; method for forecasting transformative AI is the biggest non-trust-based input into my thinking about likely timelines for transformative AI. While I&#x27;m sympathetic to parts of Eliezer Yudkowsky&#x27;s recent post on it, I overall disagree with the post, and think it&#x27;s easy to get a misimpression of the &quot;biological anchors&quot; report (which I&#x27;ll abbreviate as &quot;Bio Anchors&quot;) - and Open Philanthropy&#x27;s take on it - by reading it. 
This post has three sections:

Most of Eliezer&#x27;s critique seems directed at assumptions the report explicitly does not make about how transformative AI will be developed, and more broadly, about the connection between its (the report&#x27;s) compute estimates and all-things-considered AI timelines. One way of put…</p>

What are these CSS files called? Any projects on github or similar with a collection of them I can choose from? I can&#x27;t remember the correct word for these so a web search turns up irrelevant results...

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I totally failed to guess the killer!
Poirot was staple TV viewing when I was a teenage so the image of the character is burned well into my consciousness (thank you David Suchet) - so reading an Agatha Christie book tends to come with very easy imagination and even accents for characters.
The story is well built, told in a way that makes me think I should have been able to deduce the killer myself (and something I&#x27;ve always wondered about murder mystery stories) and does a good job of flipping my expectations on its head!
Solid stuff.</p>

And so, in a competitive market, organizations will compete to capture as little value as they can afford to, offering the most surplus to the customer, because that’s how they can grow and thrive.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The final four are here! The course on responsive design I wrote for web.dev is now complete, just in time for Christmas. The four new modules are:
Accessibility
User interface patterns
Media features
Screen configurations
These four felt quite “big picture”, and often quite future-facing. I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens. That felt like a fitting way to close out the course, bookending it nicely with the history of responsive design in the introduction.
And with that, the full course is now online. Go forth and learn responsive design!</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;ve been playing with OpenStep in a VM lately and it got me wondering what the transition from OpenStep on Intel/Sparc/NeXT hardware to Rhapsody on PPC was like.
Were there builds of basically stock OpenStep 4.2 running on PPC Macs within Apple on the early days? Were there builds with the Rhapsody UI running on Intel only while the rest of the OS was still being ported? Were these both happening at the same time in the same codebase?
I figure someone on here should have some inside information ;)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Range inputs have notoriously been a pain to style. Each browser renders the input differently requiring you to use vendor prefixes in order to create a cohesive look and feel. In this article, we’ll take a look at the quirkiness of the HTML range input and demonstrate how to style the input to look consistent across all major browsers.</p>

            >How we manage programming projects in Basecamp</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">That we manage all our programming projects in Basecamp is perhaps an obvious admission since its our own product. But it&#x27;s less obvious to some how that&#x27;s possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can&#x27;t seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn&#x27;t tied together?
The simple answer is: don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That&#x27;…</p>

Author&#x27;s note: this essay was originally published elsewhere in 2019. It&#x27;s now being permanently rehosted at this link. I&#x27;ll be rehosting a small number of other upper-quintile essays from my past writing over the coming weeks.

Quite often, I will make an agreement, and then find myself regretting it. I’ll commit to spending a certain amount of hours helping someone with their problem, or I’ll agree to take part in an outing or a party or a project, or I’ll trade some item for a certain amount of value in return, and then later find that my predictions about how I would feel were pretty far off, and I&#x27;m unhappy.
Sometimes, I just suck it up and stick it out. But sometimes I renege on the agreement. In this essay, I’d like to lay out a model for …</p>

But the uncomfortable truth is that the web is responsible for a growing proportion of carbon emissions. Rising temperatures, increasingly extreme weather events, and the failure of this year’s COP26 conference to deliver strong leadership have all highlighted the urgency of reducing our emissions if we’re to avoid disastrous climate change. The commitments of world leaders may have fallen short, but we all have a role to play, and we can’t escape our responsibility.

Each one will accept the elements to add or remove classes from, as well as or more classes to add or remove.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I have just tried to get my access back to my bank account.
Since I switch numbers frequently due to moving countries, 2FA is hell for me.
To get my account back I need a selfie with both my face and ID visible. Very hard. Guess it&#x27;s due to security.
After some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.
Fear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.
Upload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.
The other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.
Am I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer? How do non techies cope?

            >Email is the antidote</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s easy to get down on the internet as a medium for reasoned debate. Every discussion on social media that touch controversial topics seems to descent into the depths of hell in less than sixty seconds. But social media is not the internet. It&#x27;s merely one distorted expression of it. There are other ways to connect, to reason, to learn. Like email!
I don&#x27;t just mean newsletters, though I love them dearly. In fact, I&#x27;d say the majority part part of my media diet now consists of newsletters. Both from the mastodons like The New York Times and Washington Post, but just as importantly from individual journalists and writers, like Matt Levine, Glenn Loury, Bari Weiss, Ben Thompson, Zaid Jilani, Andrew Sullivan, Bob Lefsetz, Michael Shellenberger, Matt Taibbi, and Glenn Greenwald.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Could John McWhorter have gone on MSNBC or The View or PBS or NPR a year ago to talk about a new book called Woke Racism? Would a book with a title like that even have been welcome at that moment in such chambers? I doubt it.
But now it is. McWhorter has not only written an important book that&#x27;s rightfully garnering broad attention, he&#x27;s also secured an important platform by joining The New York Times as a columnist, and through these outlets, brought an oppositional argument to what five minutes ago were unassailable, widely adopted axioms of antiracism.
That&#x27;s both an incredible personal achievement for McWhorter, and an indication of how quickly sentiments can change. The religious fervor of &quot;woke&quot;, as McWhorter might put it, reached a stunning cultural dominance over the past year or t…</p>

.color-blue { color: blue; } .color-purple { color: rebeccapurple; } And you’ve got some HTML like this.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We&#x27;re famous for having very few meetings at Basecamp. We generally think meetings are toxic.
Yet, meetings do convey information, and we need to convey information, so what&#x27;s our replacement?
Writing. Long-form, complete-thought, considered writing. We write a lot at Basecamp.
Since long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they&#x27;re ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time. No synchronization of schedules required, no pulling people off their work to sit around a table (or show their face in a box on the screen), and none of the FOMO or stress that&#x27;s tied to real-time communication like group chat.
Long-form writing takes many forms at Basecamp, but &quot;Heartbeats&quot; are a prime example.

By Katey Chambers


With the new year quickly approaching, you might be starting to think about your health goals, such as losing weight, eating healthier, starting an exercise routine and/or finding ways to manage your stress. And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀


So what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them. Want to know the secret to actually sticking w…</p>

This is a high-level overview of the reasoning behind my research priorities, written as a Q&amp;A.
What’s your plan for AI alignment?
Step 1: sort out our fundamental confusions about agency
Step 2: ambitious value learning (i.e. build an AI which correctly learns human values and optimizes for them)
Step 3: …
Step 4: profit!
… and do all that before AGI kills us all.
That sounds… awfully optimistic. Do you actually think that’s viable?
Better than a 50/50 chance of working in time.
Do you just have really long timelines?
No. My median is maybe 10-15 years, though that’s more a gut estimate based on how surprised I was over the past decade rather than a carefully-considered analysis. (I wouldn’t be shocked by another AI winter, especially on an ins…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf.  In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.
This was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.
All the talks are available to stream online.
Here’s a summary of what was shared on stage:

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">&quot;Real artists ship&quot; was one of Steve Jobs&#x27; mottos. You can clearly see that ethos still in present-day Apple. There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&amp;D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren&#x27;t deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn&#x27;t shipping. And shipping is what counts.
That&#x27;s a hard ethos to live by! It&#x27;s so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it&#x27;s an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.
We&#x27;ve been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we&#x27;d make a promise, which we occasionally couldn&#x27;t keep. It sucks.
But the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It&#x27;s addicting! Yes, it&#x27;s a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.
Be a real artist. Ship.</p>

The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.
My open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one.

But a student of mine recently put together a reduced test case showing how they can severally hurt performance in apps that have high levels of interactivity.
Today, we’re going to take a look at that. Let’s dig in!
The problem When you use proxies for state-based UI, they intercept any updates to your data object, and run a render() function when that happens.</p>

            >Ask HN: In API design; minimal responses or kitchen sink responses?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;m currently refactoring my app away from websockets to a more traditional RESTful API (especially for things that should&#x27;ve been RESTful in the first place), and I wanted to know peoples&#x27; thoughts on whether response bodies should return just what you need (e.g. a need-to-know response), or return components that are common across different responses.
For example, given a hypothetical API, &#x60;GET /widgets/:id&#x60; would return a generic set of properties for the widget... the id, location, parts, etc.
Whereas &#x60;POST /widgets&#x60; could return all of that, but in a scenario where it doesn&#x27;t matter (that is, all the other values are null or defaults), then returning just &#x60;{ id }&#x60; would be sufficient.
Especially in the case of large response payloads, it may save some data from going over the wire, bu…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The most liberating aspect for me of writing emails rather than tweets is the natural limit on topics I might be tempted to have a take on. When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE&#x27;S A TAKE, THERE&#x27;S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it&#x27;s a sliver of that.
But it goes even deeper than that. When there&#x27;s no public outlet for all the possible takes, I&#x27;ve found that fewer takes actually develop. That it&#x27;s possible to see a story float by and go &quot;I don&#x27;t need or want to assume even a mental position on this&quot;. It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.
This is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…</p>

6 months ago I wrote about how 30-year-olds should basically go back to normal and no longer take many COVID precautions.
The holidays make this policy somewhat worse, because you can infect your family members. Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.
The key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them. Thus, you should probably take a few easy actions beforehand to bring this down to a small number of ho…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hello Pick The Brain Community!!


As you may know, my new book, How To Break Up With Your Friends: Finding Meaning, Connection and Boundaries in Modern Friendship (Sounds True) is officially out January 18th! Part of me is excited to write this email to you, and the other part feels vulnerable and exposed as I officially introduce the book to the world.


I sold this latest title Feb 23, 2020. I thought this topic was important then. Three weeks later we went into quarantine. I couldn’t imagine the impact it would have across the board, but specifically in how we viewed our friendships. Nearly two years later, as we slowly start to emerge back out into the wilds of social engagement, there are even more questions. 


How do I really want to spend my time and with whom?

            >Why We Can All Benefit From Training Our Mental Wellbeing</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">When we think of training, what comes to mind? Maybe it’s muscular people lifting weights intensely in a gym. Perhaps it’s people running long distances with huge packs on their backs. Perhaps we think about it from a workplace perspective, of pushing ourselves to be better, more educated in our professional lives.


The first thing that comes to mind however, probably isn’t training our mind. Our brain is one of the most important parts of our body so why don’t we make the effort to train it? Like our muscles, our brain becomes more resilient and pliable the more we work on it.


Think about when you get physically injured after not warming up. A warm up would’ve taken 10-15 minutes of your life and would’ve prevented you from hurting yourself. Without a warm up, the injury occurs and you…</p>

# What is the accessibility tree?
Assistive technology such as screen readers use Chromium’s accessibility API to interact with web content. The underlying model of this API is the accessibility tree: a tree of accessibility objects that assistive technology can query for attributes and properties and perform actions on. Web developers shape and manipulate the accessibility tree primarily through DOM properties such as ARIA attributes for HTML.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The spread syntax operator (...) takes an array or object (or other iterable) and expands its items into their own individual values.
let sandwiches &#x3D; [&#x27;tuna&#x27;, &#x27;turkey&#x27;, &#x27;pb&amp;j&#x27;]; // logs [&quot;tuna&quot;, &quot;turkey&quot;, &quot;pb&amp;j&quot;] console.log(sandwiches); // logs tuna turkey pb&amp;j console.log(...sandwiches);  The spread operator can only be used inside of functions, arrays and objects. You cannot use it on its own.
This, for example, would throw an error.
// Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#x27;.</p>

            >Ask HN: Why do developers like boring design?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For example, HN has a boring design that could benefit from improvements (e.g., make it easier to up/down-vote, navigate threads easier, etc.) and yet, many people like it this way.
Another example: Most devs that I know prefer CLI over GUI, even when GUI makes their life easier.
I&#x27;m not saying pragmatic design doesn&#x27;t have its place, but too much minimalism and simplicity is also not good IMO. In the HN example, some simple JS elements or better CSS wouldn&#x27;t hurt.

The echoes of history provide a strange comfort: We are not the first people to be struggling with this.
I don&#x27;t just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.
William Buckley&#x27;s show The Firing Line is a treasure trove in this regard.

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter.

If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar.

This is how mosts economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.

Communities prior to the advent of coinage didn’t seek to set…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A few years ago, skeuomorphism was wildly popular. From Windows XP, Vista, 7 to iOS (before v6) and android. But it seems after iOS 6, almost everybody jumped on the bandwagon of flat design. Google introduced Material and Microsoft offered Metro and later Acrylic (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/).
But now we see some trends like in iOS that show that designers are embracing some of the intuitive aspects of skeuomorphism. For example, iOS icons have some depth now and look more 3D.
Why is this happening?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Took a while to warm to the characters, but worth it in the end.The story follows an exceptionally grumpy old lady, very much a stereotypical old person who doesn&#x27;t trust anyone and exists almost just for themselves.We also meet her grandson who is equally useless in his own ways. These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I&#x27;m glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Published on December 7, 2021 12:40 AM GMT

Last year I discovered, much to my chagrin, that always-on internet socializing was costly for me. This was inconvenient both because I’d spent rather a lot of time singing the praises of social media and instant messaging, and because we were in the middle of a global pandemic that had made online socializing an almost physical necessity. I made the decision at the time to put off changing my social media diet, and that was correct. But now there is in-person socializing again, and I’m changing how I use social media and messaging. I wanted to talk about this process and how great it was for me, but kept being nagged by the thought that the internet was full of essays about how the internet is bad, all of which I ignored or actively fought with,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Last month I wrote about writing on web.dev. At that time, the first five parts of a fifteen-part course on responsive design had been published. I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:
Typography
Responsive images
The picture element
Icons
Theming
It wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.
The final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.</p>

            >Dart/React for a full fledged social media app in the short term and long term?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi folks, I&#x27;m building a social media app on Dart. I&#x27;ve been working on it for some time but it always bugs me whether I&#x27;m making a right choice by picking it over React.
Right now my plan is to build an MVP, apply to YC and then maybe keep Dart long term. Also, Our team is more familiar with Dart than React. We need a language which can work cross platform and is simpler to implement features.
Thoughts.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Watching science fiction shows/movies/games/comics/etc, the user interfaces are rather magnificent. But they rarely use elements from what people actually use.  And in actual user interfaces, there isn&#x27;t much that get&#x27;s used in SciFi.  Why is there such a large gap in these designs?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s a given that Facebook, Twitter, et al, are designed to monopolize people&#x27;s attention and energy. This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.
I&#x27;ve seen several submissions by HNers working on &#x27;friendlier&#x27; social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.
This seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I&#x27;ve tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I can completely see why Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast has become so popular. I&#x27;ve listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn&#x27;t have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan&#x27;s, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?
Such basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days. On many of the most controversial issues, even partaking in a conversation with &quot;the other side&quot; is often derided as &quot;…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">CSS is about styling boxes. In fact, the whole web is made of boxes, from the browser viewport to elements on a page. But every once in a while a new feature comes along that makes us rethink our design approach.
Round displays, for example, make it fun to play with circular clip areas. Mobile screen notches and virtual keyboards offer challenges to best organize content that stays clear of them. And dual screen or foldable devices make us rethink how to best use available space in a number of different device postures.
Sketches of a round display, a common rectangular mobile display, and a device with a foldable display.



These recent evolutions of the web platform made it both more challenging and more interesting to design products. They’re great opportunities for us to break out of o…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I want to learn about web design, aesthetics, trends, etc. but everything seems to be &quot;here&#x27;s how you do X in CSS&quot; or &quot;just look at different designs&quot;.
What resources can you recommend that teaches you about which layouts work best for different types of websites, different navigation styles (better to have it on the top/side/tucked because of Y), how to match colors and typography, etc?

Imaginary Moravec:  Sounds like a fully general counterargument to me.

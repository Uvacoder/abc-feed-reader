          <p>When debugging or analysing JavaScript, you often see people trying to find out how often a certain function is called. The common way to do that is to use a global counter variable to increment and log in the function. var i &#x3D; 0; function test(){ // other functionality i++; console.log(i); // other functionality } […]</p>

          <p>I have build many small size web apps.
I lack experience in designing medium to large application. I tried to read system design content but not able to gain confidence.
How can I do the hands-on practice of system design concepts. Please your tips, resources, plan etc.

          <p>I tried to run the old standalone version of SketchUp Make 2017 on my modern M1 Mac running macOS Monterey 12.4 recently. At first it went pretty badly, crashing on startup with the error “SketchUp quit unexpectedly.”

But I got it working!
Here’s how to get it running by removing the code signature.
The main clue came when I tried running it from the Terminal, to see if it
would show a more useful error. I got the same popup error, but also this:
rosetta error: /var/db/blahblah/SketchUp.aot: attachment of code signature supplement failed: 1
zsh: trace trap  /Applications/SketchUp\ 2017/SketchUp.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchUp

“attachment of code signature supplement failed”, eh?
We’ll just remove that code signature, then… from absolutely everything inside the app.
To do this, launch the Ter…</p>

          <p>User preference media features give you the ability to style web experiences that align with the user&#x27;s own specific preferences and needs. In other words, preference media features allow you to adapt your user experiences to your user&#x27;s expectations.


You can enhance the user experience of your website by taking the following three steps:
Discover the possibilities. Learn all the user preference media features.
Style your web experiences. Implement, for example, color, layout, and element size changes based on the preferences.
Test the UI. In DevTools, emulate the preferences and test how your website behaves.
DevTools supports a variety of emulation options. To help you avoid searching for and adjusting system and browser settings, all the emulation options reside in one place—under the Rendering tab in DevTools.
The emulation options of the user&#x27;s preferences include but are not limited to:
prefers-color scheme—light or dark color scheme
prefers-contrast—lower or higher contrast
prefers-reduced-motion—minimize motion or not
prefers-reduced-data—consume less traffic or not
For a comprehensive list of all emulation options, see Emulate CSS media features.
To discover more effects you can apply using the Rendering tab, see the Rendering tab overview.
Additionally, with DevTools, your testing capabilities aren&#x27;t limited to the single device you&#x27;re working on. You can Simulate mobile devices with Device Mode.</p>

          <p>Bootstrap Icons v1.9.0 is here with over 140 new and updated icons, including some longstanding requests for new brands, transportation options, numbers and letters, and so much more. With this release, we’re now at over 1,800 icons!
140+ new icons
Here’s a quick look at all the new icons in v1.9.0:



Tons of new brand icons including popular browsers, Ubuntu, Google Play, Android, Dropbox, and many more.
New transportation icons including cars, trains, planes, fuel, and common road signs.
New number and letter icons for 1-9, R, C, CC, H, and P (for use cases like registered trademark, copyright, Creative Commons, hospital or helicopter, and parking).
New medical icons for prescriptions, pills, and viruses.
New keyboard icons for tab and escape.
New Universal Access cions.
Redrawn cup icon, now with a steam variant for hot beverages.
Fire, finally!
There are a handful more in there as well, so have a look and put them to use in your next update! In addition, we’ve updated our docs to include mention of Composer installs.
Looking for more new icons? Head to the issue tracker to check for open requests or submit a new one.
Install
To get started, install or update via npm:
npm i bootstrap-icons


Or Composer:
composer require twbs/bootstrap-icons


You can also download the release from GitHub, or download just the SVGs and fonts (without the rest of the repository files).
Figma
The Figma file is now published to the Figma Community! It’s the same Bootstrap Icons Figma file you’ve seen from previous releases, just a little more accessible to those using the app.</p>

# Restart frame during debugging
The Restart frame feature is back! You can re-run the preceding code when paused somewhere in a function. Previously, this feature was deprecated and removed in Chrome 92 due to stability issues.
In this example, the debugger initially paused at the breakpoint (line 343) near the end of the toggleColorScheme function. To restart the debugging from the beginning of the toggleColorScheme function, expand the Call stack section in the Debugger pane, right click on toggleColorScheme and select Restart frame.

          <p>I&#x27;m an application architect for a brand new application. The application uses tons of data from multiple external systems. New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.
I did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I&#x27;m trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.
What could I have done differently?

          <p>Humans gossipped before we figured out fire, housing or farming. It’s built into our culture and possibly our DNA. Gossip informs culture and can influence connection and hierarchies. And in many communities, it’s destructive. If office gossip is benefitting you and the people you work with, good for you. But if office gossip is leading […]</p>

displaying content which FLEDGE makes use of to display ads. Shared Storage
complements fenced frames by allowing access to a carefully gated form of

          <p>I&#x27;m looking for resources/tips on how to learn concepts in system design. Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I&#x27;d also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.
In terms of what I&#x27;ve done so far...
I&#x27;ve read
- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.
- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It&#x27;s been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.
- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.
I&#x27;d really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.
Thank you very much!

          <p>Say you&#x27;re building a web SITE (not a web APPLICATION).
This is a site that simply publishes content. There&#x27;s no elaborate functionality or interactivity, other than a few web forms. The use cases is &quot;click a link, view a page, click another link, view another page, etc.&quot;
Can a full JavaScript UI framework like React or Svelte provide value here? Are they worth the trouble over simple server-side templating/rendering of HTML (SSR)? Why or why not?

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31991675 target="_blank">Ask HN: Is it a strength that HN&#x27;s UI has not changed over many years?</a>
          <p>I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.
It also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it&#x27;s easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don&#x27;t want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.
I miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.
In my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.
It makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it&#x27;s UI/UX hasn&#x27;t changed (In major ways) for many years?

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Are you looking for a UI as black as your coffee? Look no further. Dark mode, activate.
These low-light UIs are just what the doctor ordered whenever you need to get those creative juices flowing in the extra early or late hours. Use these picks to inspire your next dark mode UI design project or whenever you want to create something sleek. Even Batman would be impressed.
Nothing beats a good ole dark mode, from NFTs to banks to streaming to fitness. But remember, even if you’re not ready for the day, it cannot always be night 😉■

The Dude Ranch and a horse named Tank
June kicked off with a rare family trip. My brother and his family came down from South Dakota and we all drove out to meet my mom and her husband in Bandera, TX for two days at Mayan Dude Ranch. Because we live all over the US, we haven’t done a trip with my mom and all the grandkids, and I’m glad we pulled it together.
One of the main attractions of the dude ranch is the cowboy’ing. Lasso classes, hatchet throwing, and trail rides everyday. You can even ride a horse to a chuck wagon breakfast. This was my kids’ first horse ride experience and they both did great. Each horse had a fun name like “Whiskey” or “Pepsi” which kids love to talk about ad nauseum. Of course, being a cool…</p>

          <p>I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day conference recently, and in the Q&amp;A session afterwards I was asked about masonry layout in CSS. Masonry layout, in case you’re not aware, is where different height items are laid out in columns but, rather than being aligned on the row axis, the items below effectively move up to plug any gaps, kind of like a bricklayer — hence the name. Pinterest’s grid design is a commonly-cited example whenever the masonry conversation comes up.
The current state of masonry in CSS
Currently we can build a kind of faux-masonry (or “fakesonry”, if you will) layout in CSS by using columns.
.list {
  columns: 20rem;
  column-gap: 1rem;
}

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31971019 target="_blank">Ask HN: Which social media app has the best design in your opinion?</a>
          <p>Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don&#x27;t pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.
For me, I&#x27;ve used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.
My least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It&#x27;s a confusing mess and there&#x27;s just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.
There&#x27;s plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter&#x27;s design in general over other apps.
What about you?

          <p>I wanted to know what documentation tools are people using to write software design docs. I have mostly seen that people use whichever general purpose Docs application is being used in their organization to write software docs too (Google Docs, Notion, etc).
If there was to exist a documentation software especially for software design documents, what features would be the most important? Are there any tools which do this well?
Also, as a software engineer, have you ever felt that the documentation software you use is lacking and does not help you communicate your ideas well, due to lack of native support for content like diagrams, schemas, state machines, etc.

          <p>This is an old trick, but one I reach for just often enough to warrant a post on this blog — for no reason other than my own reference!
The problem
Suppose you have a page of content, all neatly constrained within a central wrapper. Probably using some kind of utility class, like so:
.wrapper {
  width: 70rem;
  max-width: 100%;
  margin-inline: auto;
}
(I’m using the margin-inline logical property as shorthand for margin-left and margin-right.)
But oh no! Suddenly you find yourself in need of a component that spans the full width of the page in the midst of your neatly constrained content. What to do? Well, there are a bunch of options.

          <p>CSS container queries is the new CSS feature that web developers are excited about. It may trigger a revolution in web design—from page-based responsive design to container-based responsive design.


Chrome DevTools is here to help you adopt new layout design patterns and stay on top of the latest trends. With the support of this CSS feature, you can now inspect and debug your container queries in DevTools.
The video above gives you an overview of container queries, their syntax, and how to inspect them in DevTools.
You can now discover container elements and their descendants with the corresponding badge that toggles a dotted-line overlay.
Inspect @container rules applied to descendants when containers satisfy query conditions.
To learn more about the support of container queries in DevTools, see Inspect and debug CSS container queries.</p>

          <p>Hey HN!
Recently I came across SubReply[0], a social media site, and its CSS style is really nice. So nice that I decided to rip it and modified it to become a classless CSS style.
I spend about a few hours modding the CSS, removing/replacing class-based part, fixing bugs, and add additional features, such as custom blockquotes.
The style will needs some more work, but basically it has done what it needs to do.
I would love hearing your feedbacks and comments on the project!

          <p>I am planning to host my own blog which is just a collection of simple HTML files and was wondering how to protect it from hackers. I did google about it and quora tells me its just about securing server password and 2FA. Really that simple? I want to know from proper hackers how to go about it. Note that I don&#x27;t want alternate solutions like static HTML generators etc.

Ah, social media. We’ve come a long way from Facebook 2008 to Instagram 2010 (remember Sierra or Mayfair filters, anyone?). In the past, posting 60-90 photos from a night out was acceptable, and uploading professional photos would almost instantly earn you 10K Instagram followers.
That’s enough reminiscing. Social media is now more popular than ever, so we need to be creative and intentional with the designs we choose.
These social media designs will catch your eye, whether creative wine club branding, plant, or puppy-themed posts. With posts like these, growing your (or your client’s) social audience will be a breeze. ■

          <p>I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:
- An extremely productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn&#x27;t even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.
- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.
- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set &#x60;contenteditable&#x3D;&quot;true&quot;&#x60; on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.
- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things &quot;foo&quot; when he can&#x27;t think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called &quot;foo&quot; until we came up with a name.
What are some good examples you&#x27;ve witnessed?

          <p>This article was written by Lorelei Bowman from Maze—the product research platform for modern teams.
Consider the most useful and enjoyable products you use each day. It’s likely they all have one thing in common: they were designed with your needs in mind. Great products anticipate your needs—and their nuances—before you even have them. So, how can you achieve that when designing products?
The answer is simple: with the right research, at the right time in the design process.
In this article, we’ll cover what product research is and why it’s pivotal in your product’s success. We’ll go through each stage of the design process and delve into how to use research to guide and validate your ideas throughout.

          <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;31889958 target="_blank">Ask HN: Recommended crash courses in web UI design (30 minutes or less)</a>
          <p>I self taught back end, and can now make full apps with ruby on rails. Unsurprisingly, my finished applications never look quite right. I use bootstrap which helps a lot.
I think the problem is mostly with the layout of elements on the page. I try not to overdo things with unnecessary elements, and am at a point where each individual piece of the webpage (e.g. a button, a logo, a navbar, a form) looks fine on its own, but doesn&#x27;t look professional as a whole (for reasons I&#x27;m not yet perceptive enough to detect - I can tell it&#x27;s clunky but I can&#x27;t articulate why).
I know 30 minutes is ambitious, but I&#x27;m working on an MVP and don&#x27;t have a lot of time right now (in the future, absolutely).
Any recommendations for crash courses, videos, articles, or tutorials greatly appreciated! Particularly interested to hear from anyone who wasn&#x27;t a design &#x27;natural&#x27;, and had to self teach as I am.

          <p>I wondered if the people of HN could critique my blog design.
It&#x27;s here: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog2/
The version it is meant to replace is at https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/ - the new version is meant to be less cluttered and less ugly, and honour a dark mode preference.
I&#x27;d like to know whether the new version is actually an improvement, whether you think it looks ugly, whether you think it is too hard to read, and what improvements you would suggest.
Cheers!

          <p>I know there&#x27;s discussion around RSS readers every here or there on HN. I&#x27;m curious about how many of you (especially those of you who write code) interact with publishing to or subscribing from RSS feeds as part of your work or side projects, and if you have any common pain points or favorite tools/libraries (and if it&#x27;s something you can share here, please do!).

          <p>It goes without saying that supporting Dribbble means supporting a diverse and inclusive community of designers all over the world, all year round. This month in particular, we’re proud to not only spotlight some incredibly talented LGBTQIA+ artists and designers, but also invite them to shed light on the immense impact that art and design can have on amplifying queer voices.

 I’m Elly Ayling, a designer and freelance illustrator based in Ottawa, Ontario! By day I work in non-profit to help advocate for underserved communities and fund grassroots organizations that uplift them.

          <p>We give presentations not because we have something to say, but because it&#x27;s part of the meeting theatre to show slides full of stuff. It&#x27;s not a secret that our meetings are too long and presentations are boring and no one pays attention. Tools shape the way we live. Could better presentation tools help change the culture of neverending boredom?</p>

          <p>Modifying visual media via code has always been a fascination of mine. Probably because I’m not a designer and I tend to stick to what I’m good at. One visual effect I love is seeing video reversed — it provides a sometimes hilarious perspective on a given event. Take this reversed water effect for example: […]

          <p>This article was written by Bunny Tharpe, Vice President of Marketing at Quark Software, Inc.—the global provider of content design, automation, and intelligence software.
I’m a journalism school graduate and proud “word freak” who’s worked in marketing for 30 years. But as clever as my words might be, I know they could be ignored if not for the right packaging. Thankfully, I’ve worked with some amazing graphic designers and art directors throughout my career and enjoy collaborating with them to bring content to life—from a brochure or annual report to an email campaign or entire website.
I have even more respect and appreciation for graphic designers now that I run marketing for the software company that revolutionized professional desktop publishing. During the last year, I’ve learned a …</p>

          <p># What is Early Hints?
Websites have become more sophisticated over time. As such, it&#x27;s not unusual that a server needs to perform non-trivial work (for example, access to databases, or CDNs accessing the origin server) to produce the HTML for the requested page. Unfortunately, this &quot;server think-time&quot; results in extra latency before the browser can start rendering the page. Indeed, the connection effectively goes idle for as long as it takes the server to prepare the response.
Without Early Hints: everything is blocked on the server determining how to respond for the main resource.

Early Hints is an HTTP status code (103 Early Hints) used to send a preliminary HTTP response ahead of a final response. This allows a server to send hints to the browser about critical sub-resources (for exam…</p>

# Block third-party contexts navigating to filesystem URLs
iframes can no longer navigate to filesystem URLs. Top frame support for navigating to filesystem URLs was dropped in Chrome 68.
# Remove non-standard client hint mode
Four client hints (dpr, width, viewport-width, and device-memory) have a default allowlist of self but behave as though they have a default allowlist of * on Android, contrary to the spec. This is now fixed, increasing privacy on Android by requiring explicit delegation of these hints.

These updates are for you if:
You already are familiar with the API—for example, if you&#x27;ve been observing

understand the changes made to the API.
You&#x27;re using the Attribution Reporting API in a demo or plan to test in the
origin trial.
If you&#x27;re just getting started with this API and/or have not experimented with

          <p>I’m 100% convinced that working demo-to-demo is the secret formula to making successful creative products.
Video games have a strong history of ritualizing prototypes, play testing, and following the fun. There’s even some data that suggests prototypes increase your chances of success.
Mentioned in Creativity, Inc and exemplified in the Frozen II documentary Into the Unknown, Pixar and Disney Animation use “dailies” to demo work in progress. Each animator shares their progress every day on the five seconds of film they’re responsible for.
Outlined in Ken Kocienda’s book Creative Selection, Apple’s clandestine “Project Purple” that made the iPhone embraced frequent demos when creating iOS, but at the speed at which they were working “hallway demos” would happen hours or minutes after a prev…</p>

          <p>For the past 2 months I&#x27;ve been struggling to hire a web designer to create a website for me. I wrote the entire product specification, all screens and app flows, and I want a designer to take that spec and turn it into a real product design.
Attempt #1: Direct hire
Posted a local job and hired a person based on their portfolio. We signed the contract, and they started the project. 2 weeks later I check in and all they have done is the color palette and fonts. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m unreasonable when I say this is way too little work for 2 weeks booked at 8 hours / day. I closed the contract afterwards and I consider I simply got scammed. Am I being unreasonable here?
Attempt #2: Upwork
I posted my project on Upwork for a fixed price, estimated at 300 hours and with a price per hour that matches what Upwork says is their &quot;top freelancers&quot;. I received more than 100 applications in the first 3 hours. Looking at their past work and portfolio, I notice a lot of them have linked the same projects, with the same screenshots and project description. I closed the project after I saw that, fearing another scam.
Attempt #3: LinkedIn
Posted a job for a contract-based short term project. I received less than 20 applicants in a week, and most of them sent me 5 page CVs without a portfolio. The portfolios that I got from the rest of them were very slim, presenting 1-2 project mockups which could barely be called projects, even though they called themselves experienced professionals.
I&#x27;m currently out of ideas on what to try next. I&#x27;m willing to pay top money for top work, and I mentioned this in every job ad, but for some reason all I get is scam attempts or homework projects.
Do you have some advice on how to hire high quality designers? Is there something wrong that I&#x27;m doing here?

          <p>Olivia Hoskin
      Writer &amp; Design Enthusiast 

Whether the rejection is the result of a job application, cold outreach, concept pitch, or just negative feedback, being turned down still hurts.
The self-worth of creative professionals is often tied to producing great content and products. In this case, rejection can be even more painful. It is impossible to avoid rejection entirely, but there are strategies and techniques to cope with it and sometimes utilize it as a creative advantage.
Here are five different strategies for handling rejection and even how you can turn an unpleasant experience into a positive one!

          <p>Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
There&#x27;s a new HTTP 103 status code that helps the browser
decide what content to preload before the page has even started to arrive.
The Local Font Access API gives web applications the ability
to enumerate and use fonts installed on the user&#x27;s computer.
AbortSignal.timeout() is an easier way to implement
timeouts on asynchronous APIs.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 103.
# HTTP 103 status code 103 - early hints
One way you can improve page performance is to use resource hints. They give
the browser &quot;hints&quot; about what stuff it might need later. For example,
preloading files, or connecting to a different server.

          <p>In JavaScript, it’s natural to reach for timers when something is to happen on time. But when something is to happen at the exact moment because other things depend on it, you quickly learn timers are more of a problem than a solution. They are never on time, really.

As I’ve been away from Twitter and have only encountered this link via my RSS application, I’ve taken it upon myself to contact Feedbin support to correct what must be an error in their typically inerrant feed reading application experience.
I have not yet clicked through to your web blog out of concern for my own cybersecurity. I suspect that I am being targeted for an elaborate phishing attack. No one will be jacking my clicks, I can assure you of that.
If not a nation-state level cyber-attack: might this be yet another instance of a Richard Revolution video trolling?
Or perhaps you’ve simply let your domain name renewal lapse. Has the technology behind domain parking pages advanced to a never before seen level of individualized personalization? Is this a marketing ploy by GoDaddy on this the most sacred of company holidays: GoFather’s Day?
Please contact me through the usual second-factor back-channels to ensure that everything is—as GitHub status tweets casually and confidently repeat—operating normally.
Until then I’m afraid the link will remain unapologetically and skeptically :not(:visited).
Kind domain shards,
Zach</p>

The system should allow price changes, but only honest ones.
Should we have sets of fixed package weights and volumes for food and beverages? VAT penalties for odd form factors? Or something else?

          <p>For example, in the input field the user enters the raw value as so:
[123456789]
And the formatted equivalent would be:
123,456,789
What is a good UX pattern for showing the user the thousands separators?
I&#x27;ve seen some forms where the commas / spaces are dynamically inserted in the input field (but then users end up trying to type in the commas / spaces manually).
We currently display a formatted preview of the raw input directly next to the input field (and this preview is refreshed onkeyup).
Just wondering what other good UX patterns you&#x27;ve seen that cater for this?
Thanks ^_^

          <p>My co-founder and I met while working for a company in the geospatial space. I was a product manager there, and he was an Ui/Ux designer. We worked closely on a number of projects during that time. We don&#x27;t have any special connection, but we both love the design side of things.
Looking at the design space, we discovered that there are some major issues that people face when trying to find designers for their projects -
A significant amount of time is wasted searching on Upwork and Fiverr for a qualified designer.
Most agencies screw their clients, and they are also expensive.
Billable hours for design services are not justified, causing budgets to skyrocket in most cases.
As a result, we are launching - Design Point
Consider it the Netflix of Ui/Ux design.
A monthly / yearly subscription fee will be charged.
What will you receive?
Design requests are unlimited.
Unlimited feedback modifications.
An infinite number of team members.
Unlimited number of products and brands.

          <p>I&#x27;m very good at CSS but I despise writing 1000s lines of code, one page can easily get 500 lines+. I really wish there were programs that could output good UI code, ie. Adobe XD to proper Html/CSS
but I&#x27;ve not found any.
So I tried using just UI frameworks like Bootstrap, however, but learning curve was bigger and every page looked the same. (And don&#x27;t suggest tailwind)
Maybe there is outsourced service to whom I can give designs and get html/css back for very low cost like $10-20 per page. I tried one at fiver and it was far from pixel perfect and wasn&#x27;t mobile responsive.

          <p>I&#x27;ve been wondering if Magic Trackpad adds any value to my workflow. I use my MBP in two ways:
(0) clamshell mode when connected to an external display;
(1) as a laptop.
If (0) is the case, I use mouse and keyboard but sometimes I miss the fact that I can just scroll quickly on the MBP&#x27;s Trackpad. However, pressing on the Trackpad for long hours isn&#x27;t fun either as my fingers get tired.

          <p>Every user has an RSS feed and a page for a personal feed. Front page of site is a list ranked by most followed feeds, time, etc.
Each RSS item has comments, with no karma system to discourage echo chambers. Flag system with light guidelines to avoid 4chan bigotry effect, but loose enough to let users post as freely as Reddit. Every user can see each other’s feed list and obviously add to their own.
I’m wondering if people would find this interesting and useful

          <p>The best way to make things better is to see how they are. And then do something about it. Acknowledging the problem is not the same as giving up. Too often, we’d rather not hear about it, or we choose to catastrophize as a way of protecting ourselves from the reality of what’s actually happening. […]</p>

I dialed my computer into AOL checked my mail, checked my favorite chat rooms, but I soon learned the Internet I wanted existed outside the in-app silo of America Online. I wanted to surf and create content on the information super highway. Through Angelfire and AOL Pages, I stayed up late creating my own worlds on the World Wide Web.
In 1998, I went to college and was peer pressured to use Netscape by my roommates. Netscape had an exciting atmosphere about it, and its move to open source turned fellow Computer Science nerds into gleeful converts. That move to open source would be a critical change in the life of Netscape but also in the life of the Web and in the …</p>

          <p>Hi HN! Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.
We first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.
We tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an  tag
We made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.
Even now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.
So we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!
You can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:

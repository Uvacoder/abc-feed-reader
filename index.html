            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Custom elements are part of the Web Components standard. They allow you to extend the browser&#x27;s native HTML elements or create new ones. When used well, this makes them portable and reusable in any later projects without worrying about backward compatibility or framework choices.</p>

EVERY Gundam Timeline Explained - Tim Lyu breaks down every Gundam timeline and series in an incredible and obsessive fashion. I also watched his Evangelion breakdown too. youtube.com
Scams, Art Theft and NFTs - I like Brad Colbow’s thinking, from an artist’s perspective, around NFTs. youtube.com
Make Free Stuff - Max Böck touches on one of my biggest concerns with Web3 in that it attempts “to impose even more artificial locks and transactions on users, to extract even more money”, getting away from the Web’s anti-capitalist beginnings. mxb.dev
Omnichord - Jake Albaugh makes a free musical instrument using the Web Audio API. And it’s fun. Also, subdomains rule. omnichord.jake.fun
nuxt-cms-template - Alex Riviere and Andrew Walpole figured out how to integrate Netlify CMS’s block-based editor and preview feature with a Nuxt application. It may not sound like a big deal but getting a React app and a Nuxt app working together without creating a turducken is pretty intuitive. github.com

 The decision, by Landgericht München’s third civil chamber in Munich, found that the website, by including Google-Fonts-hosted font on its pages, passed the unidentified plaintiff’s IP address to Google without authorization and without a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s an exciting time in web development. After a decade&#x27;s worth of front-end progress kept demanding ever more complicated setups, we&#x27;re finally moving in the opposite direction. With simpler tools that are still able to hit those high-fidelity user interface notes, but at a sliver of the cost in complexity.

Someone pointed me to this article by Kent C. Dodds from two years ago on AHA programing as a nice follow-up read.
 AHA (pronounced “Aha!” like you just made a discovery) is an acronym I got from Cher Scarlett which stands for “Avoid Hasty Abstractions.”
The way I think of this principle is beautifully described by Sandi Metz who wrote: “prefer duplication over the wrong abstraction.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now without any form of covid restrictions in Denmark. The daily infection numbers have remained as high as they were when the restrictions were dropped, and the positivity rate for tests is still a staggering 30%. And yet, Danish society has simply moved on.
At our kids&#x27; school, it seems that virtually everyone has had omicron by now. With anecdotes ranging from no symptoms at all to the majority experiencing mild colds to a few with flu-like symptoms. The majority of teachers have now also been through an infection, so the churn of substitutes is basically over as well.
Danish health authorities are pretty excited about all of this. Omicron is basically heralded as a blessing. The ticket out of the pandemic. By infecting the majority of Danes, society will hav…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Over the past few months I&#x27;ve been taking guitar lessons from a friend of mine who happens to be an exceptional teacher. I got lucky.
I used to play years ago, but probably only retained 10% of what I knew, so I was as close to starting from scratch as any barely-experienced player could be. Basically, I could dabble and play some chords, but my skills plateaued quickly after that. And it&#x27;s a lonely, desolate, tumbleweedy-flat plateau. You don&#x27;t get better hanging out there.
So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m back to in-person lessons. I tried YouTube, I tried some books, I tried an app or two, I tried a bunch of stuff, but I&#x27;ve discovered I simply learn guitar best with one-on-one in-person instruction.
And I&#x27;ve gotten better. But I&#x27;ve also discovered there&#x27;s another dimension that unlocks with practice: …</p>

With a persistence that is driving some progressives both inside and outside of Canada absolutely batty. How dare these truckers continue to exercise their basic political rights to freedom of assembly, association, and speech?!
Even more frustrating to the queue of disparaging observers seems to be the peaceful nature of these protests. While honking horns and blocking roads is surely thinning the patience of nearby residents, it&#x27;s hardly the kind of actions that would warrant sending in the military. Which is rather inconvenient if you&#x27;d really like the military to use its force against your domestic, political opponents!

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">For the past two years, all of Clearleft’s events have been online. Like everyone else running conferences, we had to pivot in the face of The Situation.
In hindsight, it’s remarkable how well those online events went. This was new territory for everyone—speakers, attendees, and organisers.
UX Fest was a real highlight. I had the pleasure of hosting the event, giving it my Woganesque best. It was hard work, but it paid off.
Still, it’s not quite the same as gathering together with your peers in one place for a shared collective experience. I’ve really been missing in-person events (and from what I’ve seen in people’s end-of-year blog posts, I’m not alone).
That’s why I’m absolutely thrilled that UX London is back in 2022! Save the dates; June 28th to 30th. We’ve got a new venue too: the su…</p>

In particular, we have greatly appreciated all who have offered considerate feedback, as some of that feedback has already made its way into improving the product!
While in many ways, this release is just another refinement in our ongoing product iteration, it also involved some relatively big changes. In fact, enough has changed around here that perhaps it&#x27;s helpful to first acknowledge what has not: our content, features, and functionality.
Still, things do look a bit different! So in this post, I&#x27;ll aim to detail many of the goals and design decisions behind what&#x27;s changed, and even share a little about where we&#x27;re headed…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like a lot of the time learning new CSS features doesn’t involve just learning a what a single property does, more like getting to grips with a collection of properties and how they work together — even learning a whole specification. That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">On Twitter, Kyle Shevlin was talking about how at the end of a software engineering interview, they’ll often offer a painfully-small amount of time to ask some of your own questions.
The worst part is, I often just blank in the 5 minute question time. I’ll come up with something because I’m good on my feet, but deep down it feels ineffectual. I’m not getting what I need in that time period, so let me just use the bathroom before the next interview.
— @kyleshevlin
I mentioned that I had a go-to list of questions that I literally printed and brought with me, and would bring out during this 5-minute lightning round. I definitely felt like a huge nerd pulling a set of printed questions out of a binder.
But it turned out to be really helpful, and at a couple of these interviews, my interviewer …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m not planning on leaving the industry (yet), but before I go I’d like to offer up what I know when it comes to complaining about web browsers.
I have logged hundreds of hours complaining about browsers on Twitter, on podcasts, and on this blog. I have logged thousands more hours trying to keep up with browsers and I frequently interact with people who write specs and make browsers. I have not been 100% successful in my efforts to get a  element as my legacy but I have learned a lot about giving feedback to web browsers.
Browsers are really complex
Eric Meyer recently put it very well…
[W]eb browsers are actually 60fps+ rendering environments.  They’re First-Person Scrollers.
When you complain about browsers, the first thing you must know is: Browsers are big, complex pieces of s…</p>

 Don’t repeat yourself too much, but also don’t abstract your code to an extent that it is not understandable.
 In programing, DRY is an acronym that stands for Don’t Repeat Yourself. It’s good advice that’s sometimes treated as a Holy Grail in coding.
Sometimes, a little repeated code a good thing. Today, I wanted to look at some specific examples of when DRY is good, and when it creates more problems than it solves.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi HN , 
I want to sell a few items (handmade) but I don&#x27;t want my store to look like any other e-commerce store. Ideally, I&#x27;d want it to look like a game  where my customer avatars can walk around and pick up items like they do in a physical store.
Any tips and tricks on where to start looking? Or am I off my rocker?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Spring is the season for new beginnings, a time to renew and recharge.  But more importantly just as we do a regular ‘spring clean’ of our home to declutter our personal space we should also be focused on a ‘spring cleanup for our mind’ as well.   


After all, it is your mental thoughts that create your life’s destiny


Declutter your mind, what a fabulous idea!  Begin to rid yourself of any negative thoughts and behaviours you have harbored from the past in order to live a fulfilling life now.   Let’s use a seed we plant in the earth as an analogy.  With enough nurturing and care that seed will bloom into a beautiful plant or flower.   However, at the same time if you are not taking care of it weeds will begin to grow and the plant will die off and wither away from a lack of attention.

The shared masthead navigation (across various tech-stacks) on Netlify Community (Vue/Eleventy), Remotely Interesting Podcast (Eleventy), Netlify Explorers (Next.js), Netlify Swag (Gatsby.js), and Netlify Answers (Discourse).

I’ve decided to finally package those  helpers up and formally release them as a web component!

His blog is a trove of goodness. A few weeks ago, he wrote about how the div element isn’t as terrible as some people make it out to be.
But today, I wanted to share a recent post he wrote on how to announce content to screen reader users.
 Live regions are elements that inform assistive technologies, such as screen readers, that their descendant content may update.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I have a well established phone checking habit.
If I&#x27;m developing and my tests are running I pick up my phone. If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what&#x27;s happening on it. If I&#x27;m working on a problem and I&#x27;m not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).
I don&#x27;t like the habit, but I have it.
I used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.
There are two directions I can go in (I think):
1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)
2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).
Does anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?
Does anyone have any success getting more comfortable &quot;holding&quot; the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik&#x27;s cube?!)

I don&#x27;t want to buy ads because I&#x27;m not sure if it has reached PMF, and I&#x27;ve almost used all of my organic source. How did you get your first 1000 DAU as a consumer productivity/utility app?

Programming assignments could involve making changes to open source word processors.

Yes, I know that the week finishes on Friday, but Fridays have been declared the no-meetings day at Clearleft: a chance to concentrate on heads-down work without interruption. Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.
At this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week. Once that’s all taken care of, the Thursday afternoon meeting often finishes with a fun activity.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I bought this Gameboy Pocket off eBay in the hope that I could bring it back to life...

I&#x27;d seen this before and suspected that the game couldn&#x27;t be loaded due to corruption during boot (on the GB side). I was wrong, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge!

Opening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:

Pins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:

And now the Gameboy boots with a nice clean Nintendo logo. Except… it doesn&#x27;t go past that point at all - and in fact the screen looks like it&#x27;s doing some weird flash dance, goi…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">You couldn’t have planned a better advertising campaign for crypto than Gofundme’s ham-fisted cancelation of donations intended for the protesting Canadian truckers. Their first attempt would literally have re-routed donations for the truckers to “other charities”. That sounded so crazy when I first read it that I had to dig up multiple confirming sources to believe it to be true. But true enough it was!


Thankfully, this original plan was revised after Gofundme got some “donor feedback”, including from the likes of Elon Musk (what a timeline we’re living in!). The new plan will “just” block the donations from reaching their intended recipients, and result in refunds 7-10 days(!!) from now. What a conveniently long time to keep $10 million locked up, and unable to support the protesting t…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In response to getting fined €5 million by the Dutch competition authorities, Apple has revealed an even more draconian, invasive, and frankly, terrifying scheme to collect their App Store tax from dating-app developers operating in The Netherlands. One that grants themselves the right to audit the books of any developer who dares refuse Apple&#x27;s own in-app payment system, still collects a preposterous 27% of the economic activity, and mandates a scary-sounding disclaimer to discourage users from even trying it. Yowza!
Here&#x27;s how Apple lays out the framework that&#x27;ll govern the economic and operating punishment that exactly nobody would ever in their right mind volunteer for (my emphasis):

Yes, I hit my two year anniversary of working at Netlify a week ago.
And no, my site—prior to this week—was not hosted on Netlify.
Why? Pure, unadulterated procrastination. I should have moved it over sooner. I’m very glad to have made the move. Let’s do a quick summary of the process and the pitfalls I ran into—as well as the benefits I’m seeing after the migration.
git Submodules #
I have a bunch of microsites that live on my primary domain. I had experimented with git submodules for these, but these were a bit painful to manage. I switched these over to use degit instead.
For example my Unicode Range Interchange project lives at /unicode-range-interchange/ but the source code for it lives in a different repo entirely. I could have hosted this on a separate app on…</p>

When I posted my Vibe Check №12 and End of 2021 posts, I noticed they were a bit emo as I felt “exhausted”. Well, there was a reason for that: I had COVID. Those posts might need a giant asterisks applied to them. I still stand by that exhausted vibe because I was basically sick from December 17th to January 5th or so.
Thankfully ours was a “mild” case and it did run thru the entire family. A lot of aches and sinus issues. We’re better now and resuming life. I’m like ~8% worried I have some mild form of Long COVID, but it’s allergy and mold season here in Austin so it’s hard to tel…</p>

Let’s dig in!

Hello world!
 let greeting &#x3D; document.querySelector(&#x27;.greeting&#x27;); // Get HTML content // returns &quot;
Hello world!
&quot; let html &#x3D; greeting.innerHTML; // Set HTML content // This replaces what was in there already greeting.</p>

Ideally, I can outsource most of this to a good web dev agency. We are in the MLOps space, and so some domain knowledge from the agency would be great (or the ablity to learn about the space and incorporate it into the design). Does anyone have any good recs for an agency like this?

            >The second-hand stress of social media</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I&#x27;d been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since retiring from the back-and-forth, it&#x27;s clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.
This is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I&#x27;d be surprised if you aren&#x27;t aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it&#x27;s a shock to the system.
That shock isn&#x27;t the problem, though. It&#x27;s the solution. It&#x27;s your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, producing everything from ulcers to heart disease.
I think most people already know this, but I don&#x27;t think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries. That&#x27;s a longitudinal study I&#x27;d love to see. (Blessed be those selected for the control group!)</p>

On iOS devices, Apple bans the use of alternative browser engines – this means that Apple has a monopoly over the supply of browser engines on iOS. It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine. This restriction has 2 main effects:
limiting rival browsers’ ability to differentiate themselves from Safari on factors such as speed and functionality, meaning that Safari faces less competition from other browsers than it otherwise could do; and

In this whole saga, I must admit to a guilty pleasure of chuckling at all the folks infuriated by the fact that Rogan commands such popularity from his off-the-cuff approach. Here&#x27;s his own presentation of his style:

These podcasts are very strange because they’re just conversations. And oftentimes I have no idea what I’m going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people. And that’s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I’m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and they’re just conversations, and I think that’s also the appeal of the show. It’s one of the things tha…</p>

            >Work unites what politics divide</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It&#x27;s quite literally a creative force.
When you&#x27;re focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.
This is the wisdom of the Mark Twain&#x27;s etiquette &quot;never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company&quot;. Specifically the point about &quot;polite company&quot;. It&#x27;s the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.
All this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People&#x27;s religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. 
Today social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people&#x27;s stances on the thorniest issues. It&#x27;s often hard not to know someone&#x27;s leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.
But it&#x27;s worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That&#x27;s the choice of the creative force.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden"># The permissions UX until now
When a user visits a site that requests a permission, a bubble pops up to prompt the user to make a
decision. For example, below you can see the geolocation permission prompt as implemented in Chrome
up to version 96. (You can try this and other permissions on our demo site
permission.site.)
# Most permission prompts are ignored or dismissed
Chrome&#x27;s telemetry data proves that a lot of permission prompts are ignored. You can explore the
notification permission data

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Episode 28: by Mark Cogan in Paris, France (January, 2022)
Previous episodes
In 2022, Chrome on iOS will celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Chrome is one of the most widely used iOS apps—it&#x27;s currently the number 2 Utility app in the US App Store.
Chrome on iOS provides all of the great Chrome features our users love, including Sync, Translate, Incognito, Password Manager, Autofill, and many more.
Chrome on iOS also integrates with native iOS features such as multi-window and device-wide password autofill.
However, there&#x27;s one major thing that makes Chrome on iOS very different from all other Chrome platform implementations.
Chrome on iOS doesn&#x27;t use Blink.
Because of Apple&#x27;s App Store rules, Chrome on iOS has to use the iOS platform APIs for fetching and rendering web content. So Chrome on i…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here&#x27;s what you need to know:
If you’ve tried the Auto Dark Theme origin trial, there’s a new way to
opt out at a per element level.
There’s now support for COLRv1, an evolution of the COLRv0 font
format.
And there&#x27;s plenty more.
I&#x27;m Pete LePage. Let&#x27;s dive in and
see what&#x27;s new for developers in Chrome 98.
# Opting out of auto-dark themes on Android
In Chrome 96, we started an origin trial for
Auto Dark Themes on Android.
With this feature, if your site is light themed and the user’s OS is in dark
mode, the browser applies an automatically generated dark theme to your site.
If you&#x27;ve signed up for the origin trial, and you want to opt out of the
automatically generated dark theme for a specific page, you can use a meta tag.

Or you can opt-ou…</p>

            >Cascade layers are coming to your browser</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Cascade layers (the @layer CSS rule) are coming to Chromium 99, Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4 Beta. They enable more explicit control of your CSS files to prevent style-specificity conflicts. This is particularly useful for large codebases, design systems, and when managing third party styles in applications.
Layering your CSS in a clear way prevents unexpected style overrides and promotes better CSS architecture.
# CSS specificity and the cascade
CSS specificity is how CSS decides which styles to apply to which elements. The different selectors you can use  determine the specificity of any style rule. For example, elements are less specific than classes or attributes, which are in turn less specific than IDs. This is an elemental part of learning CSS.
Folks turn to CSS naming conventions li…</p>

 Things can fail if JS is unsupported if they’re “nice to have” features. Anything critical needs to work without JavaScript.
 In response, reader Caleb Stauffer asked how I would handle a flyout or drawer nav menu (“think mobile with a hamburger icon” - shared with permission).
I’ve mostly moved away from that pattern in general, but if I did need to use it for something today, I would either…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">We had our YouTube channel for &quot;erpnext&quot; and a few videos in an older channel called &quot;webnotestech&quot;. To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main &quot;erpnext&quot; account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!
I am a pretty proficient user and I wasn&#x27;t drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.
My feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than &quot;Feedback&quot;. To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.
If any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey,
It is January February already, and it feels like time flies. In the world of technology, there are always so many news, trends, and possible distractions. On top of that, we already have so much work to do, projects to finish, and people to please. It is easy to feel empty or get burned out. Plus, we still live in the middle of an uncomfortable situation for everyone, a so far unseen pandemic situation; This causes a lot of mental problems on its own and drains a lot of energy from us.
What we can do in this case — although it’s hard to accept — is slowing down.
When I feel overwhelmed, I try to go outside as much as possible. I will get some fresh air, have a long walk and reflect on the things I do. I try to answer the question: »What brings me joy in web development?«. After that,…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hey!
Back again with another installment of Heard Something, Read Something, Saw Something. So, what do we have this time...
Heard Something
While this is a video, it&#x27;s really about sound. If you like cars, or simply dig physics, I bet you&#x27;ll find this video (and audio) fascinating. I sure did. Why do engines sound they way they do? I was surprised by what I heard. 
Hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;ygGmLbzuBU4
Read Something
While this is an article, it&#x27;s the little looping video that blew my mind. Scientists at the University of Vermont, Tufts University and Harvard University&#x27;s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering said they have discovered an entirely new form of biological reproduction different from any animal or plant known to science. Absolutely fascinating. 
Read it: https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/29/americas/xenobots-self-replicating-robots-scn/index.html
Saw Something
This brief video on Dutch street design and safety hones in specifically on the concept of continuous sidewalks. I remember noticing this when we spent time in Amsterdam a few years back, and it struck me as absolutely obvious, yet completely foreign to my eyes. BTW, I can&#x27;t wait to get back to Amsterdam — love that place. 
See it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9OfBpQgLXUc
Until next time.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today Chris and I released the 500th episode of ShopTalk. That translates to 10 years of weekly episodes (taking off holiday breaks and that one time one of us had a kid). That’s a lot of showing up and doing the work. And when I say weekly, boy howdy, I mean weekly. Peeling back the curtain a bit, I think the most Chris and I have ever been ahead is two episodes. Every week at 11:00 AM Texas time Chris and I hop on a call, sometimes with some guests, sometimes without.
It’s interesting to have a first-hand chronicle to our industry’s ebbs and flows. When we started ShopTalk “front-end developer” wasn’t even a job title, WordPress was super cool, React didn’t exist, and people were starting to dip their toes into Sass. I switched operating systems and switched back. We delved into a handfu…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Moderating content on the basis of &quot;truth&quot; is an impossible task at all but the dullest edges of discourse. Because the vanguard of truth is always in dispute. Out there on the edge, truth is a process, and it emerges faster when opposing inquiries are pursued simultaneously. This is the bedrock of science.
Rarely has this principle been proven more emphatically true than over the past few years. Our truth, their truth, your truth has been sent fumbling in the dark. Trying its way through the maze of reality, finding dead ends at every turn.
This doesn&#x27;t mean all forms of content moderation are impossible. Forbidding direct threats of violence or doxxing is doable, for example. But mixing these prohibitions together with those against &quot;misinformation&quot; or &quot;disinformation&quot; is a rhetorical sl…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Confidence is silent and insecurities are loud. This is a common quote in the world of self-development. This quote is very true and understanding it is crucial. Yet, not everybody understands it.


If you understand it, you&#x27;ll achieve a greater level of confidence that benefits you in many ways. You&#x27;ll gain more happiness, higher self-esteem, and more opportunities. Fail to understand it, and the consequences can be nasty.


Today, I&#x27;d like to break down this topic for you. If you want to know how to implement this mindset and why it’s like this, read on.


Determining confidence


In an informal language, confidence often means trusting in your abilities. If someone speaks poorly about you, can you maintain a positive opinion about you? When you&#x27;re seizing an opportunity, can deal with t…</p>

Like many people, I’ve been reading a lot about the world of crypto and NFTs and trying to get my head around it. I’ve avoided professing a strong opinion publicly, as I honestly don’t feel knowledgable enough. But it’s safe to say, I’m an NFT skeptic.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big fan of digital artists getting paid for their work — just not at any cost. And the horrendous environmental impact of the Ethereum platform is a far too high a cost in my opinion. I should add, Ethereum claims to be committed to moving to proof-of-stake, which will vastly reduce its energy consumption. It’s not there yet, but there are “Clean NF…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I situated myself in the premium white leather chair, lowered the rollercoaster-like safety harness over my torso, and carefully weighed options on the console in front of me.
&gt; Evening . . . . . . . . 20/person
&gt; Overnight . . . . . . . 100/person
&gt; Weekend . . . . . . . . 250/person
&gt; Week (BEST VALUE!)  . . 5000/family (Limit: 5)

I looked over my right shoulder to see my wife and kids’ anxious faces gleaming back at me, ready with the nervous energy of a thousand suns to embark on our well-earned vacation. It’s been awhile. Some rough, lean years working like hell but through sacrifices and extreme budgeting we had finally saved up enough.
I hesitated to tap the screen. A nervous laugh. A moment of internal calculus. Maybe a handful of evenings would be enough. Would it have the same effect? A couple weekends would surely be enough to reset. More economical. And then we’d have a little left over, just in case.
I sensed my wife’s mind-reading. I sensed her fear I would succumb to my inner self-doubt. She has been working the hardest for this. Sacrificing to create these memories. I needed to shake those miser habits we’ve formed out of years of austerity, what has become my identity.
“Oh, alright. Here we go,” I groaned and grimaced as I tapped the screen.
“You selected One Week” chimed the female voice of the console. Our chairs tilted slightly back, I felt the credits debit from my account, we were off. Finally.
The hiss of the pneumatic syringes, the sting on the spinal column, the cool and heavy breeze of the sedatives, the warm cocktail of endorphins and dopamine to stimulate our deepest dreams and desires, the chairs and harnesses catching our weight as we drifted away from consciousness. The lights in the room slowly dimmed. We would be back in a week.</p>

Whilst Julie also raised over £650 which pays for the creation.
I did post the progress on Twitter, but I don&#x27;t trust that site to be around in the next decade or two, so I&#x27;m posting it here too, since this site will be around as long as I am.</p>

# Background
A frequent request we hear from web developers is:
Current answers are not great; they rely on external libraries, CSS hacks, or
specific browser behaviors like simulating a user interaction with click().
I&#x27;m happy to share that those days will be over soon as the web platform is
introducing a canonical way to show a browser picker for  elements with
these types: &quot;date&quot;, &quot;month&quot;, &quot;week&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;datetime-local&quot;,

Today, let’s talk about it!
First, a quick aside on 4g versus 3g Alan’s article notes:
 When using lab tools such as Lighthouse, the network is tethered to simulate 3G, but mobile networks worldwide have changed recently. According to a May 2020 report by Opensignal, the worldwide average availability for 4G is 86.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">With 2021 the worst year for worker productivity, it has to be asked: is this largely because work-from-home isn&#x27;t working out?
We can find lots of excuses (resignations; worker malaise; economic decline) but isn&#x27;t most of that laid right back at the door of work-from-home?
When just a few are involved it may be viable. But I&#x27;m beginning to think, it will never fly to have almost everybody staying home. Something critical about the work environment gets broken, when nobody is minding the shop.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">What&#x27;s stood out most to me about the latest Rogan round over Neil Young&#x27;s ultimatum is the iron-clad assumption that Spotify surely must – MUST! – agree with the underlying premise. That Rogan is a menace to society because he host guests with divergent views on covid, and because he shares his unsanctioned opinion on the matter. Therefore, the only reason they&#x27;re not yanking him is fear. Fear of losing subscribers, money, marketshare, whatever. It can&#x27;t possibly be due to a genuine disagreement with the menace-to-society charge.

            >We can&#x27;t thrive without friction</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Social media platforms have been on relentless quest since their inception to remove all friction from all acts of engagement. The distance from emotion to reaction has been whittled away one A/B test at the time, and there&#x27;s barely any left. You don&#x27;t even have to portray any original sentiment today, just like or retweet that of someone else, and you&#x27;ll be microdosing on that sweet rush of belonging.
We know it too! Celebrate it, even! Have you seen that new thing that just went viral? SAVAGE. Yes, this level of virulent spread is savage. Because it&#x27;s literally been engineered in a lab to be so. All our natural human defenses have been studied by machines learning, and are now effectively and consistently evaded. No wonder this meta virus has taken over key parts of society.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Here’s something that should be obvious: People don’t like to have their grievances downplayed or dismissed. When that happens, even the smallest irritations can turn into an obsessive crusade.
Imagine you’re staying at a hotel, and the air conditioning isn’t working right. You call the front desk to mention it, and they say, oh yeah, they know about that, and someone is going to come fix that next week (after you’ve left). In the meantime, could you just open a window (down to that noisy, busy street)? Not a word of apology, no tone of contrition.
Now what was a mild annoyance – that it’s 74F degrees when you like to sleep at 69F – is suddenly the end of the world! You swell with righteous fury, swear you’ll write a letter to management, and savage the hotel in your online review.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Today we’re super excited to pull back the curtains and unveil a new UI for WebPageTest—one we’ve been working on for a while now and that we think will make it a lot easier to use for WebPageTest power users as well as folks who are just getting started in their performance journey.

WebPageTest is definitely a power tool, and it was important to us that we didn’t lose the depth and accuracy of the data that we surface. So if you’ve been using WebPageTest for a while, don’t worry—everything is still there.
But being a powerful tool doesn’t mean we want to exclude folks who may not be familiar with WebPageTest, or may be newer to performance. Quite the opposite, in fact. We want to make it easier for everyone to be able to see how their sites perform and figure out what they can do to make…</p>

This post is a technical reference to the current iteration of the experimental FLEDGE API.
The FLEDGE API is a less technical overview of the proposal.

🔎 There is a glossary of FLEDGE terms at the end of The FLEDGE API

# What is FLEDGE?
FLEDGE is a Privacy Sandbox proposal to serve
remarketing and custom audience use cases, designed so that it cannot be used by
third parties to track user browsing behavior across sites. The API enables on-device auctions by
the browser, to choose relevant ads for websites the user has previously visited.
FLEDGE is the first experiment to be implemented in Chromium within the
TURTLEDOVE family of proposals.

Today, I wanted to highlight some key insights, and my takeaways from the report. Let’s dig in!
The High-Level Summary Alan notes that IE was the “baseline” level of support for a lot of folks for years.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">That “starts in 5 seconds” thing, and that having to confirm that you’re still there thing - they can be annoying at times.
What about removing those two features, and implementing one new feature that achieves the same on your end, but which minimises the annoyance on our end, namely:
“Starts in 2 minutes” and “Press to skip”.
And I invite all UX-passionate HNers who think this is a terrible idea to please elucidate us.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">A short three years ago, I wrote about The Crushing Weight of the Facepile: how the image weight of the webmention avatar images were proving to be prohibitvely large.
At that time, I decided the best solution was to lazy load all of the Webmention Avatars. I used IntersectionObserver to do this because loading&#x3D;&quot;lazy&quot; wasn’t supported anywhere. It still isn’t on Safari 😬. I went further and threw the Webmention Likes into a closed  element so they wouldn’t load until the collapsible was expanded.
Historically, I would have solved this problem by processing and optimizing these images at build-time. But at this scale of image count, the build-time costs seemed prohibitive! I don’t think this is a priority to be fixed upstream, either.
But I finally have a new method. A better meth…</p>

Twitter released a feature that allows you to connect your crypto wallet to your Twitter account. Once you connect your wallet, you can set your profile picture to an NFT that you own.
I mean… setting your profile picture (”pfp”) wasn’t a hard problem before. Right click &gt; Save As, right? But this feature eliminates your phone’s camera roll as a middleman and instead inserts your wallet and the OpenSeas API as two third-party middlemen instead. If you’re wealthy enough to own enough NFTs that you have a hard time managing them all as profile pics, I suppose this is useful.
Ok. Whatever. Then Twitter’s implementation took it a step further and when you add your NFT as a pfp (which you could do befor…</p>

It returns a string.

I&#x27;m self-taught as a dev, but I&#x27;m considering a degree that would open doors to these types of positions. The degree I&#x27;m considering is Computer Engineering, which is advertised as being a middle layer between EE and CS degrees. I wanted to know if self-teaching is an option before I take on the student loan debt.
Are academic credentials/internships required for these kinds of jobs?

            >Ask HN: Why does productivity and health feel diametrically opposed?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I usually find myself swinging between 2 moods; One is being productive, writing, shipping code, features, working on side projects...
At that time, I&#x27;ll be also drinking, eating junk, tons of coffee, irregular sleep, staying inside for days, etc...
Then when I see that it is not very healthy, I will go to the gym, be regular, eat better and socialize. That leaves little to no energy to do more than minimum work.
It seems that I can&#x27;t merge the good parts of each cycle and be  social, healthy, while at the same time, productive and motivated.
Has anyone here been in this situation and figured their way out?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Next week, virtually all pandemic restrictions will be gone from Danish society. No mask mandates, no vaccine passports, no distancing, no limitations on bars, restaurants, or night clubs. This follows a determination by the government&#x27;s pandemic council that the virus is no longer threat to the functioning of society, and thus no longer warrants broad, societal restrictions.
What&#x27;s striking about this decision is that it&#x27;s been taken against a backdrop of all-time record infection rates. In Copenhagen, the incident rate per 100,000 was 4,735 over the past seven days! The national positivity rate on the almost quarter of a million PCR tests performed every day is now 23%! The number of hospitalizations with covid is hovering at pandemic highs.
But the number of patients in the ICU because …</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I was leaving a doctor’s appointment and as I rounded the corner to the waiting room I could hear the dulcet tones of a ukulele, but it sounded close.
My first reaction was “What in the fuck is going on?” as I scanned the ceiling for the speaker where the Muzak was coming from. Then in the waiting room I saw an older white man with a ponytail and a Hawaiian shirt calmly strumming his ukulele.
Again, I reacted, “What the fuck is going on?”
Then I caught myself. This… is… weird.
Why was he playing it in the doctors office? Was he a minstrel? Was he calming the souls of fellow patients?  A minister? A minister to himself? Does he just love Hawaii and goddamn it ain’t no one gonna stop him not even the cops at the doctors office?
I think this moment struck me like a ton of bricks because it’s been awhile since I’ve encountered weird due to the pandemic. Angry? Oh, I’ve encountered plenty of angry. Hot-headed assholes losing their shit in a Chic-fil-A drive thru, yeah I’ve seen that, but been awhile since I’ve seen weird.
The world could use a little more weird.
I miss weird. I miss old Austin.</p>

Let’s dig in!
The parseInt() method You can use the parseInt() method to convert a string into an integer (a whole number). The second argument, 10, is called the radix. This is the base number used in mathematical systems. For our use, it should always be 10.</p>

Essentially you upload a design from something like figma, and then the output is the react markup. I&#x27;m wondering who would use this, and if we need to add input support for sketches, and also wireframes, opposed to just high fidelity designs. TIA any feedback is appreciated.

As a CS student who has trouble staying focused while working, I made a Chrome extension that gamifies productivity by the minute, using a Pomodoro-like timer.
- Earn a mint for every minute worked (and block sites like Facebook, Youtube, and/or Hacker News(?) while working)
- Earn mints for completing todos from a personal todo list
- Spend mints on rewards like watching TV or treating yourself to dining out
I hope this can help others stay productive and would love feedback!

            >Just the cost of doing business [crimes]</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Dutch competition authorities just slapped Apple with a five million euro fine for refusing to comply with the country&#x27;s new requirements on App Store policies. These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business [crimes]!
The five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball points out, €50 million is &quot;spare-change-under-the-sofa&quot; money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue.
This is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there&#x27;s a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law.
I don&#x27;t necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don&#x27;t apply when you&#x27;re dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a €50 million fine is chump change.
What&#x27;ll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there&#x27;s just no way this is the last stop. If Apple willfully decides to flip off the Dutch and their national sovereignty, I think we might just see the leviathan that is the European Union awaken.</p>

The vast majority of the time, it just doesn’t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work.

This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from “I have to call Jeff into a meeting now to get his take on this new feature idea” to “I’ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live later, if needed”.

A few years ago, I realized that helping others have that “aha” moment, seeing them build cool stuff, sharing that excitement at landing their first developer job… that’s way more exciting to me than doing client work.
So now, I get to focus all of my energy on doing more of that! 🤗
Plans for 2022 I’ve got a lot of exciting stuff planned for this year.</p>

Mental health is a common problem for many individuals, globally. Most people have no idea that they have mental health issues but move on everyday just like a typical day. These issues arise from workplaces, homes, or interactions with people or activities that stress your mind. According to a study, poor mental health causes about 14 percent of all deaths worldwide and increases the mortality rate by 2.2 percent compared to individuals doing well mentally. Thirty percent of all grownups experience mental health issues at some point in their lives, with the large number among this set comprising low-income earners. Poor control of your mental health can lead to suicidal thoughts, which by itself claims 800,000 deaths a year globally. From these statistics, you can t…</p>

SEO: if your content exists at two (or more!) distinct URL endpoints, it is a SEO no-no. SE-no-no. SEO-apolo-graphql-anton-ohno (I apologize for nothing). *Ahem*. You need redirects.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’m an architect by formal education and I’ve been working in designing experiences in SaaS for the past 3 years. I navigate through technical conversations with developers and stakeholders with the knowledge I’ve picked up over the years, interacting with engineer friend circle. However I’m not satisfied by my knowledge base and I want to understand the science and art of building software from the very basics. Please share any resources that can help me start, may it be books, articles or anything else.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Geniunly curious and not competent to answer this myself.
I am a hobbyist. I don&#x27;t intend to take a career in front-end (maybe in a decade) and just hacking away on my own small projects using external APIs. It is probably for another post but after being scared of coding for such a long time, it seems so interesting and kind of a new world (despite the frustrations obviously).
The thing is, I came quite late to it and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS whilst finally delving into React which has been... welll confusing. It generally feels like an overkill and learning new things about it not enjoyable anymore as a beginner.
I have delved into Svelte in the past week and it just has been a completely different story. I am not associated with them, and I am not trying to promote it as I want to just ask whether React felt as frustrating as for me or am I missing something?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I am working on a side-project to learn web-development. The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of &quot;content&quot;(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging. So during the development I thought what if I treat everything in the app as &quot;content&quot; and create hierarchy of the content, and then create every entity relation in the DB as many-to-many. Naturally, lot of tables were created in the DB. But that got me thinking, that this design opens up lots of interesting use-cases such as sub-accounts, group accounts, sub-posts, multi-commenting, multi-reporting, comment-threading, group-posting etc.
This was a very interesting exercise. I think there will be DB performance as well as storage size issues with this design. Not sure though, never tried anything like this in practice.

Let’s dig in!
The String.padStart() method The String.padStart() method adds characters to the beginning of a string if it’s less than a certain length. This is particularly useful for numbers that need leading 0’s (but can do so much more than that).
The String.padStart() method accepts two arguments: the length the string should be, and what characters to add if it’s not that length.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Sometimes doing a thing one way is just common sense, but most of the time there is some innovation involved, e.g. GrapheneOS malloc. The code is covered by license, but are design decisions? Especially given the fact, that they were openly discussed before the code was written?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Hi there HN.
Aamu.app is an app that I&#x27;ve made and I hope to get some feedback.
It aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.
Why did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I&#x27;m talking about things like Microsoft&#x27;s offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.
I realize it&#x27;s quite a big app for one person to do, but let&#x27;s just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn&#x27;t stop after I had started it.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’d love to read through a book on React, but I’m surprised at the poor reviews on Amazon. Perhaps I’m looking in the wrong place. Who can point me to a good one (that maybe isn’t sold from Amazon)?
Alternatively, why should I not be considering React? Is everybody using something else these days? Looking to build a front-end to interact with some REST APIs.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">The Mac is such an inconvenient platform for Apple. It prevents the company from making any credible claim of an impending security catastrophe, if lawmakers force the iPhone to allow installation of apps without the App Store. With the Mac, we have almost forty years of proof that computers don&#x27;t need an App Store to be safe.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Saw a fascinating idea in a tweet from @simevidas to show favicons on external links on a site. Full credit for the original idea to Kiko Beats.
The implementation used an icon font to store the favicons. I think we can improve on this idea (do y’all want to maintain an icon font 😅) to save some future maintenance using IndieWeb Avatar. This will allow the images to auto-update when a site updates their favicon (per server caching rules).
Add this CSS to see it in action:
a[href*&#x3D;&quot;twitter.com&quot;]:before {
  content: &quot;&quot;;
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: text-bottom;
  width: 1em;
  height: 1em;
  margin: 0 .2em;
  background-size: contain;
  background-image: url(&quot;https://v1.indieweb-avatar.11ty.dev/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitter.com%2F/&quot;);

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I wrote about how I created a page on The Session with instructions for installing the site to your home screen. When I said that I included screenshots on that page, I may have underplayed the effort involved. It was real faff.
I’ve got an iPhone so generating screenshots (and video) from that wasn’t too bad. But I don’t have access to an Android phone. I found myself scouring the web for templates that I could use to mockup a screenshot of the address bar.
That got me thinking…
Wouldn’t it be cool if there were a service that generated those screenshots for you? You give it a URL, and it spits out screenshots of the site complete with overlays showing the installation flow on Android and iOS. It could even generate the img markup, complete with differently-scaled images for the srcset attribute.
Download the images. Copy that markup. Paste it into a page on your site. Boom! Now you’ve got somewhere to point your visitors to if you’d like them to install your progressive web app.
There are already some services out there for generating screenshots of mobile phones but they’re missing is the menu overlays for adding to home screen.
The devrels at both Google and Microsoft have been doing a great job of promoting progressive web apps. They’ve built tools to help you with tasks like generating icons or creating your web app manifest. It would be sooooo nifty if those tools also generated instructional screenshots for adding to home screen!</p>

            >Ask HN: Are System Design documents out of fashion?</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I’ve been hopping around a number of large non-FAANG enterprises for the past few years. In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design / Architecture documentation.
I struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals/antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)
Digging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.
Cloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf/Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.
In the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ/Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.
All of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.
So HN:
Do you teams document these architectural designs?
Have I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?
How do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt / Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?
Appreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Before I build something myself, I wanted to check if there is anything already out there that does this.
Essentially want to build custom apps by designing them in a visual workflow builder to define the interactivity.
Imagine being able to drag a &quot;Prompt&quot; activity, define the content you want to display to the user, and the options for how the user can respond (ex: show Yes/No buttons, or other choices), and then have a decision activity that can evaluate what the user chose and branch to some other UI - like another prompt dialog, or a file upload dialog, or a form, etc etc.
The more activities that you implement the richer the app you could build.
Right now I am leaning towards using &quot;node red&quot; as the workflow engine, and building a bunch of custom nodes that represent all the UI functionality I want - and then implementing an app host in Angular or React that will integrate with the workflow - probably via web socket messages.
So at the end of the day, this App Host UI is receiving commands from the workflow as far as what content to display to the user, and then sending back what the user is doing with the UI to the workflow so it can send follow up commands.

            >Free is never forever</a>
            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Google gave away free email on custom domains for years. This unsurprisingly lured lots of people into switching to Gmail. But now the party is over, and what used to be free will now easily cost $500/year or more (if you have 10 users on a custom domain). Yikes.
Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;m not actually against Google charging for email. The long deep freeze of innovation in email came as a result of Google giving away free* service. (* It wasn&#x27;t ever free FREE, of course, but the price in data and attention wasn&#x27;t obvious to most before they got hooked.)
The problem is the switcheroo. When you give something away for free for years, and then suddenly show up with a demand for payment, people are rightfully going to feel like it&#x27;s a stickup. Especially if they have over a decade&#x27;s worth of data that&#x27;s difficult to get out locked inside that box you gave them for &quot;free&quot;.
It feels even more so if the vendor showing up with demands for payment is a monopolist like Google. Who controls the majority of all email that flows in the US. Then it very much feels like you got suckered. Oh, we were just the stepping stone for you to get the dominant marketshare, and now that you&#x27;ve captured it, you return for the loot? Gah.
Email wasn&#x27;t ever free to offer. Especially not the unlimited kind with gigabytes of storage that gave Gmail its original splash. It&#x27;s just that Google monetized it through data plunder (like reading your purchase receipts!), attention drains (promoted emails!), and now finally with a paid switcheroo for the most locked-in accounts.
You could of course also just pay with cash monies from the get go. And vote with those dollars for what you&#x27;d like to see more of in the world. How&#x27;s that for a New Year&#x27;s resolution: Paying for things with money, and skipping the ones that aren&#x27;t worth it.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">In North Dakota, Apple sent Erik Neuenschwander, a chief privacy engineer, to make its case that opening up the App Store to free and fair competition on payment processing would be bad for privacy. He focused in a relatively sober tone on the sanctity of Apple&#x27;s integration and curation as arguments for why they deserved their monopoly privileges. A technical witness perhaps stretching the truth to fit the narrative needed, but at least feeling somewhat constrained by it.
In Arizona, Apple sent Kyle Andeer, the Chief Compliance Offer, to claim that preventing Apple from shaking down app developers for 30% would be tantamount to &quot;a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store&quot; because it would &quot;allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free&quot;.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Pessimism can spark an idea.
Annoyance can drive ingenuity.
Disappointment can redirect effort towards change.
But creativity requires optimism.
Creativity isn&#x27;t about starting something. It&#x27;s about making something. Making requires sustained effort, and sustained effort requires fuel.
That fuel is optimism.
When you run out, momentum dies, and effort grinds to a halt.
When you run out, creativity converts to drudgery.
When you run out, you give up.
If you&#x27;re making something that doesn&#x27;t exist, you must believe that it can. That&#x27;s optimism, that&#x27;s the feeling. That&#x27;s the chemical reaction. Without it, creativity is inert.</p>

Not only does Wordle have a very sweet backstory, but it’s also unashamedly on the web. If you want to play, you go to the URL powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle. That’s it. No need to download an app.
That hasn’t stopped some nefarious developers trying to trick people into downloading their clones of Wordle from app stores. App stores, which are meant to be curated and safe, are in fact filled with dodgy knock-offs and scams. Contrary to popular belief, the web is quite literally a safer bet.
Wordle has a web app manifest, which means you can add it to your home screen and it will behave just like a native app (although I don’t believe it has…</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Context: I am a full stack developer that uses React to build simple UIs for technical simulations.
When working with React I spent a lot of time, also out of curiousity, on different solutions for certain problems (Think of Redux, MobX, and Recoil or React wrappers like React-Konva).
With Svelte I don&#x27;t do that. It seems most basic functionality is included in a thin layer of abstract above HTML, CSS, and JS (ref. The truth about Svelte by Rich Harris) and the Svelte standard library. From state management, reactivity, and with SvelteKit, to SSR and code splitting. For problems not covered is was, until now, always easy to use TS/JS.
Question: is Svelte lean and pragmatic or is it missing something?
Note: I know React, use it, and like it (especially with hooks &amp; Redux-Toolkit).
As I am far from senior, maybe there are some complexities I am not seeing yet.

There&#x27;s of course no way of knowing either way based on what was presented. This is an anonymous account of an unnamed company detailing personal but unverifiable experiences. (Not unlike a myriad of threads claiming to expose various isms in a similar anonymous, unverifiable format!)

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">I just discovered that I really like watching people code, and it&#x27;s a great source of learning for me just through observation.
My main requirements:
- Not a &quot;tutorial&quot;. I don&#x27;t want someone who has already scripted and prepared all the steps for the video. Looking for something more improvisational, of course, ideally they should be experienced or produce high quality code and at least partially explain their thought process as they&#x27;re doing it.
- Preferably web dev focused - I&#x27;ve been trying to hone my skills with HTML / CSS / JS / TS and React mainly, but really open to anything if I think I can learn some good coding practices from it.
An example of a recent one I liked was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;K77xThbu66A
However, I would prefer something a little less hacky than this if possible. Still was a decent view to follow along.

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Yesterday, one of my students asked me how I record my JavaScript video courses and workshop lessons.
Today, I wanted to share both my technical setup and general approach to making videos. Let’s dig in!
Screen recording I use Screenflow for screen recording.
It’s macOS only. If you’re feeling cheap, you can also just use QuickTime, but I found that makes my fans spin like crazy. Screenflow also has some great editing features, including easy cropping and zooming, noise isolation, and so on.</p>

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">This issue was raised here many times: RSS is convinient and versatile. It&#x27;s mostly gone due to lack of authentication and monetization paths (ads/premium content for sign ups)
This lack of features led us back to email newsletters with businesses like Substack shining in it.
Yet, email is restrictive, unorganized, and its html support is cryptic at best. It also in the control of the sender (push) unlike RSS that is under the control of the receiver (pull).
Do we have an RSS alternative that adds authentication and other features to allow for the decentralization of email, with modern features enabled by smart RSS readers?

            <p class="mt-0.5 overflow-x-hidden">Matt Taibbi wrote a great piece called The Left is Now the Right last year. It detailed how many of the tactics and thought processes anyone who came of age in the 90s would recognize as &quot;of the right&quot; are now being used by the opposite side of the political spectrum. A clip:

Conservatives once tried to legislate what went on in your bedroom; now it’s the left that obsesses over sexual codicils, not just for the bedroom but everywhere. Right-wingers from time to time made headlines campaigning against everything from The Last Temptation of Christ to “Fuck the Police,” though we laughed at the idea that Ice Cube made cops literally unsafe, and it was understood an artist had to do something fairly ambitious, like piss on a crucifix in public, to get conservative protesters off their couche…</p>

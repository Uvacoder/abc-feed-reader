So developing your CSS mobile-first should also be great, too…right? \nWell, not necessarily. Classic mobile-first CSS development is based on the principle of overwriting style declarations: you begin your CSS with default style declarations, and overwrite and/or add new styles as you add breakpoints with min-width media queries for larger viewports (for a good overview see “What is Mobile First CSS and Why Does It Rock?”). But all those exceptions create complexity and inefficiency, which in turn can lead to an increased testing effort and a code base that’s harder to maintain.

In case you’re not aware of what “alt text” or (“alternative” text) is, it’s the text value of the alt attribute of an <img>. It should describe the image (although in practice doesn’t always!).\nAs a user you might never notice alt text, but there are contexts where it’s incredibly important. Screenreaders will announce the alt attribute to a user, so for someone who is blind or partially sighted, the alt attribute can provide vital content that might otherwise be missed. It’s not good practice to put important text content in an image, but if for some reason you do have to do it then providing the same information in the alt text is essential to ensuring screenreader users get an equivalent experience.\nAnother time alt…",

          "description": "For the past 2 months I've been struggling to hire a web designer to create a website for me. I wrote the entire product specification, all screens and app flows, and I want a designer to take that spec and turn it into a real product design.\nAttempt #1: Direct hire\nPosted a local job and hired a person based on their portfolio. We signed the contract, and they started the project. 2 weeks later I check in and all they have done is the color palette and fonts. I don't think I'm unreasonable when I say this is way too little work for 2 weeks booked at 8 hours / day. I closed the contract afterwards and I consider I simply got scammed. Am I being unreasonable here?\nAttempt #2: Upwork\nI posted my project on Upwork for a fixed price, estimated at 300 hours and with a price per hour that matches what Upwork says is their \"top freelancers\". I received more than 100 applications in the first 3 hours. Looking at their past work and portfolio, I notice a lot of them have linked the same projects, with the same screenshots and project description. I closed the project after I saw that, fearing another scam.\nAttempt #3: LinkedIn\nPosted a job for a contract-based short term project. I received less than 20 applicants in a week, and most of them sent me 5 page CVs without a portfolio. The portfolios that I got from the rest of them were very slim, presenting 1-2 project mockups which could barely be called projects, even though they called themselves experienced professionals.\nI'm currently out of ideas on what to try next. I'm willing to pay top money for top work, and I mentioned this in every job ad, but for some reason all I get is scam attempts or homework projects.\nDo you have some advice on how to hire high quality designers? Is there something wrong that I'm doing here?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31827449\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 9",

          "description": "My co-founder and I met while working for a company in the geospatial space. I was a product manager there, and he was an Ui/Ux designer. We worked closely on a number of projects during that time. We don't have any special connection, but we both love the design side of things.\nLooking at the design space, we discovered that there are some major issues that people face when trying to find designers for their projects -\nA significant amount of time is wasted searching on Upwork and Fiverr for a qualified designer.\nMost agencies screw their clients, and they are also expensive.\nBillable hours for design services are not justified, causing budgets to skyrocket in most cases.\nAs a result, we are launching - Design Point\nConsider it the Netflix of Ui/Ux design.\nA monthly / yearly subscription fee will be charged.\nWhat will you receive?\nDesign requests are unlimited.\nUnlimited feedback modifications.\nAn infinite number of team members.\nUnlimited number of products and brands.\nproject prototypes.\nIncludes all file sources.\nStop or cancel at any time.\nHow it will work ?\nSubscribe to a plan that meets your needs and submit as many design requests as you want.\nReceive design updates within 1-3 business days depending on complexity.\nUnlimited feedback changes until you are 200% happy. There is no limits!\nPricing ?\n7 days trial pack - $40\nMonthly - $199\nYearly - $2100\nTo Get Started---\nYou can reach out to us - gupil@designpoint.io\nSchedule a meeting with us - https://calendly.com/design-point/introduction\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31788099\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I'm very good at CSS but I despise writing 1000s lines of code, one page can easily get 500 lines+. I really wish there were programs that could output good UI code, ie. Adobe XD to proper Html/CSS\nbut I've not found any.\nSo I tried using just UI frameworks like Bootstrap, however, but learning curve was bigger and every page looked the same. (And don't suggest tailwind)\nMaybe there is outsourced service to whom I can give designs and get html/css back for very low cost like $10-20 per page. I tried one at fiver and it was far from pixel perfect and wasn't mobile responsive.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31786600\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I'm currently working on a side-project that, for a change, I'd like to fully structure first before diving into the code.\nI know there are specific UI/UX tools, like Framer, Adobe XD and Sketch. There are also specific methodologies for software architecture, like creating ERDs and flowcharts. Same for the server infrastructure and persistent datastorage.\nWhat I'm looking for is one tool that combines all the various domains of a piece of software with varying levels of complexity. So something that gives a full overview that also allows you to 'zoom in' on specific layers for more detail.\nIs there any tool out there that provides this level of varied complexity and global overview? Of do you use something that's not made for it but works well?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31703199\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 12",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nwhile building something entirely, I realized that there is a lack of tools to pick colors for websites and web apps. While there certainly is an abundance of tools for color palettes, but they mostly give you three to five bright or pastel colors. Not what you need for websites. For that, you need one or two primary colors, and then stuff like text color, background, and so on.\nSo, together with another web dev I built a small web tool that allows picking exactly the colors you need for web projects and live preview your palette on a selection of demo websites.\nThe first version of the tool is online at https://colorsforwebsites.com. Free and no sign up.\nWe are already using this to for early stage projects, so I hope this provides value for you as well. Of course we are also happy about any and all feedback.\nCheerz :)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31585749\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "How do you design, track, and measure experiments you decide to do on yourself?\nExamples of experiments:\n - Reduce my workouts from three 1h workouts to two 1.5h workouts.\n - Start taking magnesium supplements for better sleep.\n - Try intermittent fasting.\n - Start writing tests first (TDD).\nI wonder whether there is a good resource or your anecdote about how to try the \"scientific method\" on yourself. It seems that some people are better at applying it than others. I think Tim Ferris has been the main person I would think about in this context.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31546814\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 5",

It’s a fairly new tech stack and the position is Senior/remote. I will have an onboarding buddy though.\nI will have to dig through a large codbase, and the codebase of the framework we are using.  Besides that, the business part is also completely new to me.\nI wonder: What are your tools and habits you use to accomplish something, store gained knowledge, dig through codebases etc.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31728507\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

I took an accidental 10 year hiatus and I've been polishing it up recently to get back into it.\nIt used to be really popular to promote your RSS feed. Might have just been the circles I swam in, but people knew what to do with it. I've maintained this big orange RSS symbol in my main navigation and I wonder: Does anybody actually know what to do with this now?\nFirefox used to offer subscription options but I don't see anything in the navbar any more. If you click the symbol on my page, you just see an ugly page of XML.\nIn the vain hope that somebody might want to see what I'm writing and be notified about it, how do I enable this? Do I have to post updates on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and etc, etc?\nI've been consuming RSS for all this time but the rest of the world seems to have moved on.

          "description": "Hey!\nI’m interested in finding resources, postmortems, case studies, as well as personal success/failure stories of measuring development teams while scaling them - when it gets harder to do that directly, as you would in a small team.\nNow, don’t get me wrong, I’m not advocating for metrics like tasks delivered, commits done, lines of code changed (hard to even write the latter ones down without cringing). This kind of “productivity output measuring” sounds easily-gamed, very stressful, and ultimately fairly useless.\nThis can be a totally different approach - streamlining the identification of blockers, exploring what time sinks developers are being hindered by. I think this handbook by okay.com is a very good example of a great resource looking at the problem from that side: https://www.okayhq.com/handbook/getting-started/what-is\nMeasuring the time CI/CD pipelines take, PR’s take to be reviewed, etc. looks like a very sensible approach.\nWhat are your experiences? What worked for you? What did you hate?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31609471\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

Other times I am in flow at 100% and feel like if I didn't have to sleep or have meetings I could get everything on my plate finished.\nHow do others feel? Are you mostly working at your optimal productivity / motivation level? Has it changed as you got older?\nMaybe it's just me but there are days I get nothing done, and when you have daily stand-ups you simply cannot say that so you just make shit up or say you were swamped in busy work.\nI'm wondering if there is a better philosophy to managing people with this in mind, although I am finding that humans need deadlines and external pressure in some form or nothing gets done.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31563325\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN! Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.\nWe first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.\nWe tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an  tag\nWe made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.\nEven now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.\nSo we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!\nYou can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:\nSample Website: https://philipwee.github.io/\nGithub Repository: https://github.com/PhilipWee/philipwee.github.io\nFigma File: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119632484827501100\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31779160\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

Many of these teens went on to become web developers.\nLater, many teenagers learned these skills as they customized their LiveJournal or MySpace.\nLater still, many teenagers learned these skills customizing their Tumblr.\nDoes Gen Z have anything like this, that is creating a pipeline to web development? I know Tumblr and LiveJournal still exist, but they don't seem to be popular with Gen Z at all.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31667761\nPoints: 33\n# Comments: 54",

I don’t think I actually read any more than my usual annual allotment of words.\nI’m glad that I’m tracking my reading here on my own site. About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.\nI continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.\nNow that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…",

I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens.

I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:\nTypography\nResponsive images\nThe picture element\nIcons\nTheming\nIt wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.\nThe final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.",

As Terence puts it:\nThere are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering?

          "description": "Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:\nsection:has(img) {\n  background: lightgray;\n}\nBut eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.\nYou could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:\nform:has(input:invalid) {\n  border: 2px solid red;\n}\nThe parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.\nIt’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():\n@supports selector(:has(*)) {\n  .info,\n  .warning {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\nOn a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.",

The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁\n— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021\n \nI replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!\nThe experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.\nSpeaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.",

The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one.

The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well.

          "description": "I'm building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software's API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.\nI'm having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I'm certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I'd like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.\nThe problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don't see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.\nIn a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that's not an option.\nIs my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29710441\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

Very hard. Guess it's due to security.\nAfter some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.\nFear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.\nUpload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.\nThe other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.\nAm I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer?

This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.\nI've seen several submissions by HNers working on 'friendlier' social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.\nThis seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I've tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29506095\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. \nWe have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.\nA user can have different roles in each sub org.\nE.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.\nNow user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.\nNow when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.\nIn standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.\nAlso we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.\nIs there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29459196\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

But at my full time job it's not always possible due to different reasons =\\\nSo I've been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).\nI decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.\nThis time it's a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.\nI tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.\nThis is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29437527\nPoints: 189\n# Comments: 30",

We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare's public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.\nIs there a way to satisfy these reqs?\n1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)\n2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)\n3.

Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.\nAll the talks are available to stream online.\nHere’s a summary of what was shared on stage:\n\nReact 18 and concurrent fea…",

These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.",

And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\nSo what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them. Want to know the secret to actually sticking w…",

Part of me is excited to write this email to you, and the other part feels vulnerable and exposed as I officially introduce the book to the world.\n\n\nI sold this latest title Feb 23, 2020. I thought this topic was important then. Three weeks later we went into quarantine. I couldn’t imagine the impact it would have across the board, but specifically in how we viewed our friendships. Nearly two years later, as we slowly start to emerge back out into the wilds of social engagement, there are even more questions. \n\n\nHow do I really want to spend my time and with whom? \n\n\nDo you want to c…",

Perhaps it’s people running long distances with huge packs on their backs. Perhaps we think about it from a workplace perspective, of pushing ourselves to be better, more educated in our professional lives.\n\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind however, probably isn’t training our mind. Our brain is one of the most important parts of our body so why don’t we make the effort to train it? Like our muscles, our brain becomes more resilient and pliable the more we work on it.\n\n\nThink about when you get physically injured after not warming up.

He's stressed over it, he's agonized over it, and he's spent a few too many hours thinking about all the reasons why and why not.\nThis morning he told me he was worried that it wouldn't make him happy.\nOf course it won't, I said. But that's the wrong question.\nThe better question is \"Will I enjoy it?\"\nMaking you happy is too high a bar for anything. It's unfair to ask that of anyone or anything — it's something you can really only ask yourself, or bring yourself.\nBut enjoying something? That's possible! It's very much within reach.\nSo I said, will you enjoy the car? Could you see yourself enjoying the car? Will you enjoy the drive?\nAnd that's a much easier question to answer. And an expectation that's easier to accept.\nObjects (and experiences) don't make you anything, you have to enjoy them.\nEnjoying something is plenty.\nI think he's going to buy one.",

We write a lot at Basecamp.\nSince long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they're ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time.

          "description": "That we manage all our programming projects in Basecamp is perhaps an obvious admission since its our own product. But it's less obvious to some how that's possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can't seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn't tied together?\nThe simple answer is: don't. You don't need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That'…",

McWhorter has not only written an important book that's rightfully garnering broad attention, he's also secured an important platform by joining The New York Times as a columnist, and through these outlets, brought an oppositional argument to what five minutes ago were unassailable, widely adopted axioms of antiracism.\nThat's both an incredible personal achievement for McWhorter, and an indication of how quickly sentiments can change.

          "description": "\"Real artists ship\" was one of Steve Jobs' mottos. You can clearly see that ethos still in present-day Apple. There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren't deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn't shipping. And shipping is what counts.\nThat's a hard ethos to live by! It's so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it's an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.\nWe've been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we'd make a promise, which we occasionally couldn't keep. It sucks.\nBut the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It's addicting! Yes, it's a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.\nBe a real artist. Ship.",

With email, it's a sliver of that.\nBut it goes even deeper than that. When there's no public outlet for all the possible takes, I've found that fewer takes actually develop. That it's possible to see a story float by and go \"I don't need or want to assume even a mental position on this\".

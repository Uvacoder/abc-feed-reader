          "description": "The final episode of season three of the Clearleft podcast is out. Ah, what a bittersweet feeling! On the hand it’s sad that the season has come to an end. But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.\nEpisode six is all about design principles. That’s a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.\nBut for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.\nKatie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite’s time for her to talk me through it. I’ve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.\nIt’s nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.\n\nAnd with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!",

Instead it’s down to everyone to figure out individually what’s right.\nEveryone is evaluating the risks, making calculations and coming to different conclusions. It’s only natural that everyone—myself incuded—thinks they’ve found the Goldilocks zone. “That person is being far too blasé! And that person is being far too cautious! But I’m doing exactly the right thing.”\nWith that in mind, I’m trying not to be judgemental about the decisions other people are making (apart from the decsion not to get vaccinated—I’m judgemental as hell about those selfish assholes). For example, I wear a mask when I’m on public transport. Other people don’t. I try not to judge them (although re…",

It’s all about measuring design.\nThere was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn’t there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?\nFor this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.\nThis episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it’s well worth your time. Have a listen.\n\nThis is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!",

          "description": "We’re past the halfway mark for this season of the Clearleft podcast. Episode four came out today. It’s all about innovation.\nAt the beginning of the episode, I think you can hear the scorn in my voice. Y’see, innovation is one of the words—like “disruptive”—that gets thrown around a lot and everyone assumes it only has positive connotations. But words like “innovative” and “disruptive” can be applied to endeavours that are not good for the world.\nBitcoin, for example, could rightly be described as innovative (and disruptive) but it’s also a planet-destroying ponzi scheme—like a lovechild of the trolley problem and the paperclip maximizer designed to generate the most amount of waste for the least amount of value.\nSo, yeah, I’m not a fan of innovation for innovation’s sake. But don’t worry. For this episode of the podcast I set my personal feelings to one side and let the episode act as a conduit for much smarter people.\nThe whole thing clocks in at 25 minutes but I think this episode might have the widest range of contributors yet. There are snippets from an internal Clearleft discussion, soundbites from a panel discussion, extracts from conference talks, as well as interviews with individuals. From Clearleft there’s Chris How, Andy Thornton, Jon Aizlewood and Lorenzo Ferronato. From the panel discussion there’s Janna Bastow, Matt Cooper-Wright, Dorota Biniecka and Akshan Ish. And from UX Fest there’s Radhika Dutt, Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein.\nI happily defer to their expertise on this topic. Have a listen and hear what they have to say.",

Three of the six episodes of the current season are available with another three still to come.\nIn case you missed them, the episodes of season three released so far are:\nCoaching\nWhat’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentorship?\nDesign Engineering\nA role that sits at the intersection—or rather, the gap—between design and engineering.\nDesign Research\nThe journey from evaluative research to generative research.\nThat’s quite a mixed bag. You might think that there’s no particular unifying to a season of the podcast.\nWell, that’s kind of true. There’s no specific theme. But each season does have a meta-grouping.\nAt Clearleft, we think about our services in three interconnected categories: explore, create, and grow.\n“Explore” is all about the big strategic picture.\n“Create” is the nitty-gritty work of delivery.\n“Grow” is what connects those together.\nEach season of the podcast focuses on one of those categories. This season it’s all about “explore” with a bit of “grow” thrown in.\nThe next three episodes of this season will double down on the big-picture thinking. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but I’ll just remind you that if you’re not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, I highly recommend rectifying that situation.\nSubscribe via RSS, or on Apple, Google, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts from.\nAnd if you’re already subscribed …thank you. If you’re enjoying listening to it half as much as I’m enjoying making it, then I’m enjoying it twice as much as you.\nSeriously though, if you like what you hear, please share it around. Drop a link to the Clearleft podcast into your work Slack channel or share it in a tweet.\nThank you for listening.",

After years of deconstructing and providing valuable commentary on what makes games good, Mark is putting his reputation at stake and trying his hand at game design. Mark has tried making games before but never succeeded because he always started making his game from the wrong direction.\nWhat is the right direction? Well… the answer is: Prototypes.\nMark starts with an ill-fated tale of a Picross-style game he made with folders full of pixel art, animations, juicy buttons but there was one big problem: it wasn’t any fun.

Its usage is low\nand declining. It underperforms when compared to other payment methods in\ntime-to-checkout and completion rate. Developers can switch to other payment\nmethods as an alternative. Examples include Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Samsung\nPay.\n# Removal timeline\nChrome 96\nThe basic-card method is deprecated in the Reporting API.\nChrome 100\nThe basic-card method will be removed.\n# Deprecation policy\nTo keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform\nwhich have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an\nAPI, such as:\nThey are superseded by newer APIs.\nThey are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and\nconsistency with other browsers.\nThey are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and\nthus can increase the burden of support for web developers.\nSome of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.\nChrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI's,\nessentially:\nAnnounce on the\nblink-dev\nmailing list.\nSet warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.\nWait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.\nYou can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\ndeprecated filter and\nremoved features by applying the removed\nfilter. We will also try to\nsummarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.",

What connection\nare they using (for example Wi-Fi, 2G) and so on. The answers to these questions\ncan affect product development decisions such as choosing the\ntechnologies to render the content. This report provides timeline data to inform\ndevelopers on these questions for a list of countries, such as the US, Brazil,\nJapan, and others. Three platforms are included when data is available: Android,\nWindows, and ChromeOS.\nLooking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to\nthink about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of\nusers have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in\nthe US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another\nexample: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices\nhave RAM larger than 5 GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower\nthan India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help\ndevelopers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device\ncharacteristics.\nThis data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.\nIn Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google\nto help improve Chrome's feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash\nreports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled\nduring installation or in Chrome's settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,\nand metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable\nwith other datasets.

          "description": "Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?\nBackground: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn't written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).\nA few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can't \"takeover\" a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\nI and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).\nShe is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I'm currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I'm getting more and more bored every day.\nHowever, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I'm not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I've done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.\nIs there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28953459\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 9",

Way back in 2012, my cofounder Fred (fredsters_s) and I got into YC with one idea in mind, but soon pivoted once we saw a pattern among most of the other companies in our cohort.\nThese startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality. Given that we were sure CI/CD would be the future of software development, we decided to dedicate our start…",

Is there any design patterns/ specific tools/ constructs to solve such problems ? I am gravitating towards as event driven model - but not sure what to look out for this problem statement.\nI am not looking for a complete solution, but opinions/ pointers to any resource would be greatly appreciated.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28928156\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.\nFor my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.\nThe most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.\nThat could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.\nBut I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 \"blobs\" on it that represent min, max and most likely.\nThe advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.\nI then went on Google to see if there is any research to \"Designing Components\" but I'm kinda overwhelmed by \"top 10 UI/UX component\" answers and MATERIAL.\nSo I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28918018\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "The Scala compiler is a fascinating tool which powers a large proportion of the Guardian’s infrastructure. But sometimes the work that it does can seem somewhat mysterious. Guardian Scala developer Paul Roberts explores in detail one aspect of this mystery and looks at how understanding it can help us write code more effectively\nScala is the programming language which underpins many of the most important tools which allow the Guardian to deliver its journalism. And when compared to other languages, Scala has a lot of wonderful tools for making your code simpler. However, sometimes this is achieved by hiding a lot of the complexity. Usually this is a good thing – it’s the compiler writer’s problem and we have the luxury of just being able to ignore it and get on with what we are trying to do. But occasionally it can actually influence the way our code is running and as a result, present us with surprises.\nTo have something to work with, I began playing around with solutions to Project Euler problem 39 (spoilers for problems after 100 are discouraged but this one is OK).\nIf p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.\n{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}\n Continue reading...",

There was a little computer in the corner that caught his interest and he left with every book on computing he could find. At home, Roberto took out a pad of paper and started writing his first code. Years later, when Roberto decided he probably couldn’t follow his original dream of being a mathematician, he decided to pursue a career in computing.\nWhat was the path that eventually brought you to the Guardian?\n Continue reading...",

This month saw Safari drop a new release that includes support for a tonne of new stuff, including :has() (A.K.A. the “parent selector”), accent-color, and Cascade Layers (all of which are covered in my Smashing article), as well as some additional gems:\nTrigonometric functions\nI almost missed this line when skim-reading the Safari release announcement, but yep, Webkit has delivered support for CSS trigonometric functions! I’m unbelievably excited about the possibilities this will open up for creative CSS, …",

          "description": "You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:\nThere is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.\nI hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.\nRead the article →",

Congrats!\nFinally, 3 weeks later, after a few phone calls, Sectigo issued the certificate. Woohoo! The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.\nIn their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).\nAnd then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.\nSo you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo? Haha nope,…",

          "description": "Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you've got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn't make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.\nTo make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.\nWith layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.\nAntetype is also build on web concepts: \nThat means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).\nVideo of Antetype's features + prototypes built with it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY\nWebsite with examples + demo videos:\nhttps://www.antetype.com\nRegister to download it (macOS only):\nhttps://cloud.antetype.com/register/\n(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don't want to do it yourself.)\nI would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30852905\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.\nWith Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you're faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.\nThis doesn't seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I'd like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they're not doing that.\nI'm happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30817570\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30812988\nPoints: 112\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I'm immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.\nHence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;\n1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.\n2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.\nThose who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.\nI've been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.\nI hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30804893\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

While catering to implementers of user agents, they are generally a goldmine of solid information.\nI'd like also to get inspired by quality work on the web, but inspecting websites pretty much never yields anything that resembles a readable document, HTML semantics and CSS quality are generally in a disastrous state.\nThus my question, can you suggest websites who's html and css can be considered of extremely high standards?\nI can't list many safe for MDN and wikipedia.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30815217\nPoints: 18\n# Comments: 10",

When I recently updated my newsletter service server software nearly everything broke into pieces. I was using mailtrain v1 for a long time now but it’s deprecated and using old node versions.

So far it’s a pretty manual process again since it doesn’t support RSS-campaigns. At some point in future I want to publish the newsletter via Kirby to the Mailcoach API.\nBut at this point I now changed my template as well to a modern MJML based template code.

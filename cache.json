          "description": "🎉 After nearly ten years of weekly podcasts, Shop Talk has entered into a new realm: Video. Under the umbrella of the CSS-Tricks YouTube channel we’ve started posting daily-ish videos about front-end web development. This is a 🔥 year for CSS, so there’s no shortage of topics or #hotdrama to talk about and demo.\nWe’re still dialing in the formula, but it’s shaping up to look like 15~20 minute videos delivered thrice weekly. Math-wise, that’s not too different than doing another one hour podcast every week. Video of course is a little more involved, you need to spend a bit more effort planning out tech demos. Keeping our same (overly?) casual feel makes it all sustainable for us. If Chris and I were doing video content full time it might make sense to write and edit a bit more, but both of us have day jobs, are running companies, and contributing code.\nOne nice by-product of exploring video is that we get a chance to re-explain mouth-coding examples or overly visual concepts that were probably confusing on the audio podcast. As much as I love podcasting, the lack of visual examples for a visual field like Web Design and Development is a limitation. I like that the YouTube series is like supplementary material to ideas covered in the podcast, rather than a replacement.\nOkay! That’s it! I hope you enjoy the little foray into video.\nWatch on YouTube\nAnd I wouldn’t be a YouTuber if I didn’t say… Be sure to drop a like and subscribe, that really helps us out in the algorithm. And ring that bell for notifications when new videos come out.",

          "description": "Developers are constantly wondering about what kind of audience they are\ndeveloping for. Are they using high end devices with large RAM? What connection\nare they using (for example Wi-Fi, 2G) and so on. The answers to these questions\ncan affect product development decisions such as choosing the\ntechnologies to render the content. This report provides timeline data to inform\ndevelopers on these questions for a list of countries, such as the US, Brazil,\nJapan, and others. Three platforms are included when data is available: Android,\nWindows, and ChromeOS.\nLooking at the data, there might be some interesting things for developers to\nthink about. For example, in Japan on the Android platform, the majority of\nusers have five to eight cores, and the prevalence is quite a bit higher than in\nthe US, and much higher than in next billion user (NBU) countries. Another\nexample: if you look at RAM on Android, a very low percentage of Brazil devices\nhave RAM larger than 5 GB, which is much lower than in the US, and also lower\nthan India. We hope publishing information like this periodically will help\ndevelopers have a better understanding of the Chrome user device\ncharacteristics.\nThis data comes from usage statistics sent to Google from Chrome installations.\nIn Chrome, users can choose to send usage statistics and crash reports to Google\nto help improve Chrome's feature set and stability. Usage statistics and crash\nreports are enabled by default for Chrome consumer installs and can be disabled\nduring installation or in Chrome's settings. Metrics collection is pseudonymous,\nand metrics are tagged by an opaque per-install identifier that is not joinable\nwith other datasets.  If the metrics collection is re-enabled, the unique\nidentifier will also be reset. We used the data collected to calculate the\nvarious statistics in this\nreport.\nPhoto by Halacious on Unsplash",

But it feels good to look back at six great episodes all gathered together.\nEpisode six is all about design principles. That’s a topic close to my heart. I collect design principles.\nBut for this podcast episode the focus is on one specific project. Clearleft worked with Citizens Advice on a recent project that ended up having design principles at the heart of it. It worked as a great focus for the episode, and a way of exploring design principles in general. As Katie put it, this about searching for principles for design principles.\nKatie and Maite worked hard on nailing the design principles for the Citizens Advice project. I was able to get some of Maite’s time for her to talk me through it. I’ve also got some thoughts from my fellow Clearlefties Andy and Chris on the topic of design principles in general.\nIt’s nineteen minutes long and well worth a listen.\n\nAnd with that, season three of the Clearleft podcast is a wrap!",

Instead it’s down to everyone to figure out individually what’s right.\nEveryone is evaluating the risks, making calculations and coming to different conclusions. It’s only natural that everyone—myself incuded—thinks they’ve found the Goldilocks zone. “That person is being far too blasé! And that person is being far too cautious! But I’m doing exactly the right thing.”\nWith that in mind, I’m trying not to be judgemental about the decisions other people are making (apart from the decsion not to get vaccinated—I’m judgemental as hell about those selfish assholes).

It’s all about measuring design.\nThere was a bit of a theme running through UX Fest earlier this year. On the one hand, there was all the talk of designers learning to speak the language of business (to get that coveted seat at the table), which means talking in numbers. But on the other hand, isn’t there a real danger in reducing user experience to numbers in a spreadsheet?\nFor this episode I put the narrative together using lots of snippets from different talks, not just from UX Fest but from previous Clearleft events too. I also got some good hot takes from my colleagues Chris, Andy, and Maite. Oh, and it opens with former US Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara. If you know, you know.\nThis episode comes in at 22 and a half minutes and I think it’s well worth your time. Have a listen.\n\nThis is the penultimate episode of season three. Just one more to go!",

          "description": "We’re past the halfway mark for this season of the Clearleft podcast. Episode four came out today. It’s all about innovation.\nAt the beginning of the episode, I think you can hear the scorn in my voice. Y’see, innovation is one of the words—like “disruptive”—that gets thrown around a lot and everyone assumes it only has positive connotations. But words like “innovative” and “disruptive” can be applied to endeavours that are not good for the world.\nBitcoin, for example, could rightly be described as innovative (and disruptive) but it’s also a planet-destroying ponzi scheme—like a lovechild of the trolley problem and the paperclip maximizer designed to generate the most amount of waste for the least amount of value.\nSo, yeah, I’m not a fan of innovation for innovation’s sake. But don’t worry. For this episode of the podcast I set my personal feelings to one side and let the episode act as a conduit for much smarter people.\nThe whole thing clocks in at 25 minutes but I think this episode might have the widest range of contributors yet. There are snippets from an internal Clearleft discussion, soundbites from a panel discussion, extracts from conference talks, as well as interviews with individuals. From Clearleft there’s Chris How, Andy Thornton, Jon Aizlewood and Lorenzo Ferronato. From the panel discussion there’s Janna Bastow, Matt Cooper-Wright, Dorota Biniecka and Akshan Ish. And from UX Fest there’s Radhika Dutt, Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein.\nI happily defer to their expertise on this topic. Have a listen and hear what they have to say.",

Three of the six episodes of the current season are available with another three still to come.\nIn case you missed them, the episodes of season three released so far are:\nCoaching\nWhat’s the difference between training, coaching, and mentorship?\nDesign Engineering\nA role that sits at the intersection—or rather, the gap—between design and engineering.\nDesign Research\nThe journey from evaluative research to generative research.\nThat’s quite a mixed bag. You might think that there’s no particular unifying to a season of the podcast.\nWell, that’s kind of true. There’s no specific theme. But each season does have a meta-grouping.\nAt Clearleft, we think about our services in three interconnected categories: explore, create, and grow.\n“Explore” is all about the big strategic picture.\n“Create” is the nitty-gritty work of delivery.\n“Grow” is what connects those together.\nEach season of the podcast focuses on one of those categories. This season it’s all about “explore” with a bit of “grow” thrown in.\nThe next three episodes of this season will double down on the big-picture thinking. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but I’ll just remind you that if you’re not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, I highly recommend rectifying that situation.\nSubscribe via RSS, or on Apple, Google, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts from.\nAnd if you’re already subscribed …thank you.

          "description": "We’re halfway through the third season of the Clearleft podcast already!\nEpisode three is all about design research. I like the narrative structure of this. It’s a bit like a whodunnit, but it’s more like a whydunnit. The “why” question is “why aren’t companies hiring more researchers?”\nThe scene of the crime is this year’s UX Fest, where talks by both Teresa Torres and Gregg Bernstein uncovered the shocking lack of researchers. From there, I take up the investigation with Maite Otondo and Stephanie Troeth.\nI won’t spoil it but by the end there’s an answer to the mystery.\nI learned a lot along the way too. I realised how many axes of research there are. There’s qualitative research (stories, emotion, and context) and then there’s quantitative research (volume and data). But there’s also evualative research (testing a hyphothesis) and generative research (exploring a problem space before creating a solution). By my count that gives four possible combos: qualitative evaluative research, quantitative evaluative research, qualitative generative research, and quantitative generative research. Phew!\nSteph was a terrific guest. Only a fraction of our conversation made it into the episode, but we chatted for ages.\nAnd Maite kind of blew my mind too, especially when she was talking about the relationship between research and design and she said:\nResearch is about the present and design is about the future.\n🤯\nI’m going to use that quote again in a future episode. In fact, this episode on design research leads directly into the next two episodes. You won’t want to miss them. So if you’re not already subscribed to the Clearleft podcast, you should get on that, whether it’s via the RSS feed, Apple, Google, Spotify, Overcast, or wherever you get your podcasts from.\nHave a listen to this episode on design research and if you’re a researcher yourself, remember that unlike most companies we value research at Clearleft and that’s why we’re hiring another researcher right now.

Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.\nBut how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future?

This should restore the ability to import and compile Bootstrap’s Sass in create-react-app.\nAdded border-radius sizes to small and large .form-selects\nAdded align-self: center to buttons for improved rendering in flex containers\nFixed Collapse regression that prevented toggling between sibling children\nUpdated JS Sanitizer to add sms in the SAFE_URL_PATTERN\nImproved docs around .img-fluid\nAdded role=\"switch\" to our form switches in our docs\nImplemented GitHub Issue forms to replace our previous issue templates.\nUp next\nUp next is our v5.2.0 release, adding more utility improvements and fixing an issue with how Sass handles re-assigned maps and variables. Alongside that, we’ll be shipping an update to v4 soon as well.\nGet the release\nHead to https://getbootstrap.com for the latest. It’s also been pushed to npm:\nnpm i bootstrap\n\n\nReview the GitHub v5.1.2 release changelog for a complete list of changes since our last release.\nSupport the team\nVisit our Open Collective page or our team members' GitHub profiles to help support the maintainers contributing to Bootstrap.",

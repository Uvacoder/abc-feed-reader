          "description": "I’ve been reading the excellent Design For Safety by Eva PenzeyMoog. There was a line that really stood out to me:\nThe idea that it’s alright to do whatever unethical thing is currently the industry norm is widespread in tech, and dangerous.\nIt stood out to me because I had been thinking about certain practices that are widespread, accepted, and yet strike me as deeply problematic. These practices involve tracking users.\nThe first problem is that even the terminology I’m using would be rejected. When you track users on your website, it’s called analytics. Or maybe it’s stats. If you track users on a large enough scale, I guess you get to just call it data.\nThose words—“analytics”, “stats”, and “data”—are often used when the more accurate word would be “tracking.”\nOr to put it another way; …",

          "description": "I work a four-day week now.\nIt started with the first lockdown. Actually, for a while there, I was working just two days a week while we took a “wait and see” attitude at Clearleft to see how The Situation was going to affect work. We weathered that storm, but rather than going back to a full five-day week I decided to try switching to four days instead.\nThis meant taking a pay cut. Time is literally money when it comes to work. But I decided it was worth it. That’s a privileged position to be in, I know. I managed to pay off the mortgage on our home last year so that reduced some financial pressure. But I also turned fifty, which made me think that I should really be padding some kind of theoretical nest egg. Still, the opportunity to reduce working hours looked good to me.\nThe ideal situ…",

These are tools that live on your machine—or on the server—taking what you’ve written and transforming it into the raw materials of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nThe second category of tools are those that are made of the raw materials of the web: CSS frameworks and JavaScript libraries.\nI think the criteria for evaluating these different kinds of tools should be very different.\nFor the first category, developer-facing tools, use whatever you want. …",

          "description": "I just finished watching The Billion Dollar Code, a German languge miniseries on Netflix. It’s no Halt and Catch Fire, but it combines ’90s nostalgia, early web tech, and an opportunity for me to exercise my German comprehension.\nIt’s based on a true story, but with amalgamated characters. The plot, which centres around the preparation for a court case, inevitably invites comparison to The Social Network, although this time the viewpoint is from that of the underdogs trying to take on the incumbent. The incumbent is Google. The underdogs are ART+COM, artist-hackers who created the technology later used by Google Earth.\nEarly on, one of the characters says something about creating a one-to-one model of the whole world. That phrase struck me as familiar…\nI remember being at the inaugural Future Of Web Apps conference  in London back in 2006. Discussing the talks with friends afterwards, we all got a kick out of the speaker from Google, who happened to be German. His content and delivery was like a wonderfully Stranglovesque mad scientist. I’m sure I remember him saying something like “vee made a vun-to-vun model of the vurld.”\nHis name was Steffen Meschkat.  I liveblogged the talk at the time. Turns out he was indeed on the team at ART+COM when they created Terravision, the technology later appropriated by Google (he ended up working at Google, which doesn’t make for as exciting a story as the TV show).\nHis 2006 talk was all about Ajax, something he was very familiar with, being on the Google Maps team. The Internet Archive even has a copy of the original audio!\nIt’s easy to forget now just how much hype there was around Ajax back then.  It prompted me to write a book about combining Ajax and progressive enhancement.\nThese days, no one talks about Ajax. But that’s not because the technology went away. Quite the opposite. The technology became so ubiquituous that it no longer even needs a label.\nA web developer today might ask “what’s Ajax?” in the same way that a fish might ask “what’s water?”",

          "description": "Chrome Dev Summit kicked off yesterday. The opening keynote had its usual share of announcements.\nThere was quite a bit of talk about privacy, which sounds good in theory, but then we were told that Google would be partnering with “industry stakeholders.” That’s probably code for the kind of ad-tech sharks that have been making a concerted effort to infest W3C groups. Beware.\nBut once Una was on-screen, the topics shifted to the kind of design and development updates that don’t have sinister overtones.\nMy favourite moment was when Una said:\nWe’re also partnering with Jeremy Keith of Clearleft to launch Learn Responsive Design on web.dev. This is a free online course with everything you need to know about designing for the new responsive web of today.\nThis is what’s been keeping me busy for…",

          "description": "Back in April I gave a talk at An Event Apart Spring Summit. The talk was called The State Of The Web, and I’ve published the transcript. I’ve also published the video.\nI put a lot of work into this talk and I think it paid off. I wrote about preparing the talk. I also wrote about recording it. I also published links related to the talk. It was an intense process, but a rewarding one.\nI almost called the talk The Overview Effect. My main goal with the talk was to instil a sense of perspective. Hence the references to the famous Earthrise photograph.\nOn the one hand, I wanted the audience to grasp just how far the web has come. So the first half of the talk is a bit of a trip down memory lane, with a constant return to just how much we can accomplish in browsers today. It’s all very positive and upbeat.\nThen I twist the knife. Having shown just how far we’ve progressed technically, I switch gears the moment I say:\nThe biggest challenges facing the World Wide Web today are not technical challenges.\nThen I dive into those challenges, as I see them. It turns out that technical challenges would be preferable to the seemingly intractable problems of today’s web.\nI almost wish I could’ve flipped the order: talk about the negative stuff first but then finish with the positive. I worry that the talk could be a bit of a downer. Still, I tried to finish on an optimistic note.\nI won’t spoil it any more for you. Watch the video or have a read of The State Of The Web.",

          "description": "I had an extra long weekend recently. It was four days of being a culture vulture. It was also four days of ever-increasing risk assessment.\nIt began on Thursday morning with the first Salter Cane band practice in eighteen months. That was pretty safe—three of us in a room, reminding ourselves of how the songs go. I honestly thought it could’ve been a disaster and that I wouldn’t remember anything, but thanks to a little bit of last-minute revision the evening before, it actually went really well. And boy, did it feel good to plug in and play those songs again.\nLater that day, Jessica went up to London. We spent that evening in the Royal Opera House, watching a ballet, The Dante Project. We wore masks. Not everyone else did.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the indoor gatherings continued. We went to the …",

The demo sets the play-state of the animation depending on the user’s motion preferences (using the prefers-reduced-motion media query). Users could also click the button to toggle motion on and off, which also changes the text of the button to “Turn on motion” or “Turn off motion”. Here’s the original version:\nSee the Pen \n  Reduced-motion toggle by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nScott pointed out that some screenreaders wouldn’t announce the change to the button text when the button is clicked.\nI have one suggestion though, per the accessibility of the toggle control.

Scroll snap, Motion Path, Level 5 Media Queries and CSS functions min(), max() and clamp() are just some of the CSS features that have got me excited in the last year or two, but even these are old-hat compared to the buzz around container queries, or LCH colours, for instance. It can be hard to keep up with the pace of change, but as a developer I would argue that one of the most important qualities to have is curiosity.

To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.\nChrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI's,\nessentially:\nAnnounce on the\nblink-dev\nmailing list.\nSet warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.\nWait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.\nYou can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\ndeprecated filter and\nremoved features by applying the removed\nfilter. We will also try to\nsummarize some of the changes, reasoning, and migration paths in these posts.",

          "description": "I'm really confused on this. My understanding on Golang's intentions and design is that it is an intentionally simple language lacking most of traditional OO features. The language is relying on interfaces (and Generics?) for doing most of the things you'd do with classic OO.\nYet I see job ads requiring and even classes teaching Design Pattterns with Golang. And by inquiry I see that they're not talking about Golang-specific DPs (that would make sense) but about fitting traditional OO DPs (and principles like SOLID) to Golang. Which in turn seems to me like bending the language to something it was not designed for in order to fit into models we developed for traditional OO languages like java and C++.\nUnsure what is going on here and what the consensus on best practice is (if any).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29078533\nPoints: 12\n# Comments: 6",

          "description": "Are there any, or can we maybe come up with (i.e. suggestions please if it seems like a good idea), HTTP headers that browsers can send to sites that automatically instruct them in terms of:\n1. The kinds of cookies I'm willing to accept (e.g. strictly necessary). For example, `X-Prefer-Cookies: strictly-necessary` or `X-Prefer-Cookies: all`.\n2. The fact that I don't, and probably never will, care about your newsletter. (If your content really interests me, I'll find a way through your UI to subscribe.) For example: `X-Offer-Newsletter: no`, or `X-Offer-Newsletter: yes`.\nIf you wanted to facilitate more general UX preference indications from the client side, you could potentially come up with a scheme like `X-UX-Preferences: strictly-necessary-cookies; no-newsletters`.\nThis way I can set these preferences once in my browser and be done with your annoying cookie selection and newsletter popups (if your site honours those headers, of course).\nI think that, if most websites honoured those headers, it might just fix 80% of what I personally feel is wrong with the modern web. (The other 20% I think involves completely eradicating online advertising-driven business models from the face of the planet, which I think is quite a bit harder to achieve than this.)\nEDIT: grammar\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29052246\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Question: Hacker News, if someone were designing a new programming language (or library system within an existing language) to mitigate supply chain attacks, what features would be most important to you?\nBackground: Open-source code has been an amazing boon for software productivity. However, I believe that most of the code that companies run isn't written by their own developers, it is from various packages and frameworks written by outside individuals and groups. My main focus is writing data intensive software where malicious actors, or just poorly written code, could compromise the confidentiality and/or integrity of customer data via a popular package/dependency. Better sandboxing of relatively untrusted code could be a huge boon for applications that have lots of plugins (think Chrome of VS code).\nA few thoughts I have had on this front is limiting access of untrusted code to system calls that control file and network access is critical. Also, there would be a need to ensure that dependencies can't \"takeover\" a process by overwriting the call-stack to run their own code or spawning a new thread / process. Interested in your thoughts.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28988755\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\nI and my wife are thinking about starting a web design company, which would target smaller businesses. We would provide custom web and mobile app designs, custom website development, but I was also thinking about providing simple web hosting as well (for small wordpress sites or something similar).\nShe is great with digital arts and recently started learning web design and UX and she loves it. I'm currently working at a FAANG as a software engineer, but I'm getting more and more bored every day.\nHowever, we are a bit worried whether it is even worth starting a business like this nowadays, because there are countless businesses providing the same services, and I'm not sure if we could get enough clients. Also I've done some research, and found many landing page and website builder tools, some of them are even free.\nIs there anything that could make us stand out from the crowd? Is there anything missing in this web design/development space? What could we do to siphon some clients from big web design/development/hosting companies? (other than being extra cheap)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28953459\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 9",

Way back in 2012, my cofounder Fred (fredsters_s) and I got into YC with one idea in mind, but soon pivoted once we saw a pattern among most of the other companies in our cohort.\nThese startups were trying to push code through CI/CD pipelines as frequently as possible, but were stymied by quality assurance. Labor-intensive QA (specifically, smoke, regression, and other UI tests) tended to be the bottleneck preventing CI/CD from delivering on its promise of speed and efficiency. That left a frustrating dilemma for these teams: slow down the release to do QA, or move faster at the expense of product quality. Given that we were sure CI/CD would be the future of software development, we decided to dedicate our start…",

          "description": "Hi HN,\nI have to do a university assignment that is about software engineering. Unfortunately, designing user-interfaces (in the UX sense) is not a concern, even though we all have to write a user interfaces.\nFor my assignment, one component will have to register the minimum, maximum and most likely cost of building a car. These are just estimates that an engineer will do.\nThe most naive way of doing so would be to put three textboxes that allow the engineer to input whatever he wants. However, only numbers are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer knows that a car has to cost at least x, and they are not willing to pay more than y.\nThat could all be done with textboxes, placeholders, validators that show error messages and so on.\nBut I think a possibly better way would be to have some kind of slider with 3 \"blobs\" on it that represent min, max and most likely.\nThe advantages would be that the engineer cannot even select values that are out of bound and having the 3 knobs on the line might even visually represent some skewness to his estimation.\nI then went on Google to see if there is any research to \"Designing Components\" but I'm kinda overwhelmed by \"top 10 UI/UX component\" answers and MATERIAL.\nSo I was wondering, how is your process on designing components?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28918018\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I think this might be one of the first balanced or non-invested reads of what \"Web3\" means and Sloan's opening notes really resonate:\n\nIt’s for kids. I mean that in a good way! I think Web3 has resonated powerfully with young people because it feels like something genuinely new, and it feels like it can be theirs. Who could argue with those feelings? Not me.\n\nThe notes go on and I come away with the same general sense that I've had so far of the crowd cheering on for Web3: it's about making money. Which is fine, the world runs on capitalism for the most part, it's just not entirely for me.\nAnd I think that's the rub, the stories I know of the creation and the spread of the web (and indeed the internet) came from those wanting to share and do good. The stories I've read were never about making money but instead creating a place for others.\nI will concede that I don't tend to read the \"got rich by selling X web start up\" - but it's that start in the web that's what drives me, and what I love about the web. It's what I love about the Open Web.\nWeb Zero if you will. It was about sharing, community, learning and finding a place in the world.\nSource: society.robinsloan.com",

This post will be updated as the implementation progresses. \n\n\nWhat is the EyeDropper API? #\nMany creative applications allow users to pick colors from parts of the app window or even from the\nentire screen, typically using an eyedropper metaphor.\nPhotoshop, for example, lets users sample colors from the canvas so they don't have to guess a color\nand risk getting it wrong. PowerPoint also has an eyedropper tool,\nuseful when setting the outline or fill color of a shape. Even Chromium DevTools has an eyedropper\nyou can use when editing colors in the CSS styles panel so you don't have to remember or copy the\ncolor code from somewhere else.\nIf you're building a creative application with web technologies, yo…",

One such web application has been Photoshop. The idea of running software as complex as Photoshop directly in the browser would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago. However, by using various new standardized web technologies, Adobe has now brought a public beta of Photoshop to the web.\nIn this post, we'd like to share for the first time the details of how our collaboration is extending Photoshop to the web.

Multiple ways to optimize images call for an intelligent \"image component\" with performance solutions baked in as a default.\nThe Aurora team worked with Next.js to build one such component. The goal was to create an optimized image template that web developers could further customize.

However, sample efficiency remains a key challenge, with prominent methods requiring millions (or even billions) of environment steps to train. Recently, there has been significant progress in sample efficient image-based RL algorithms; however, consistent human-level performance on the Atari game benchmark remains an elusive goal.\nWe propose a sample efficient model-based visual RL algorithm built on MuZero, which we name EfficientZero. Our method achieves 190.4% mean human performance and 116.0% median performance on the Atari 100k benchmark with only two hours of real-time game experience and outperforms the state SAC in some tasks on the DMControl 100k benchmark. This is the first time an algorithm achieves super-human performance on Atari games with such little data. EfficientZero's performance is also close to DQN's performance at 200 million frames while we consume 500 times less data.\nEfficientZero's low sample complexity and high performance can bring RL closer to real-world applicability. We implement our algorithm in an easy-to-understand manner and it is available at this https URL. We hope it will accelerate the research of MCTS-based RL algorithms in the wider community.\nThis work is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China, the 2030 Innovation Megaprojects “Program on New Generation Artificial Intelligence” (Grant No. 2021AAA0150000).\nSome have said that poor sample-efficiency on ALE has been a reason to downplay DRL progress or implications. The primary boost in EfficientZero (table 3), pushing it past the human benchmark, is some simple self-supervised learning (SimSiam on predicted vs actual observations).\nDiscuss",

(See also: qntm’s Lena.)\nIt would be great to guarantee digital people some control over their situation: 1. to control their local environment and sensations, 2. to avoid unauthorized rewinding or duplicating.\nI’ll describe how you could modify the code of a digital person so that they retain this control even if an adversary has access to their source code. This would be very expensive with current cryptography.

I'll post these periodically whenever I can fill up three slots — one for something interesting I recently listened to, one for something I read that I liked, and one for something I saw that caught my eye. Hope you enjoy these.\n—\nHeard Something\nReally enjoyed this conversation between Lex Fridman and Steve Viscelli. Steve is an economic sociologist who embedded as a long haul trucker for 6 months to go through the training, learn the ropes, get to know the people, absorb the stories, and understand the business — and the job — of trucking in America. It's a 3 hour conversation, and it's worth it.\nHear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3Wpy6gE4So\nRead Something\nPeople often ask me if I know any good books on writing. One of my favorites is \"Revising Prose\" by Richard Lanham, but I may have a new favorite. It's called \"Several short sentences about writing\" by Verlyn Klinkenborg. It's all about the sentence, and it's written one sentence at a time, rather than in traditional paragraphs. It's smart, and it gets to creamy center of what makes certain writing so delicious.\nRead it: https://bookshop.org/books/several-short-sentences-about-writing/9780307279415\nSaw Something\nWe've all seen the periodic table, but do you know where each element originated? Here's Jennifer Johnson's novel take on the table that shows you where everything came from.\nSee it: http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~jaj/nucleo/\n  \n      \n        \n\n  \nUntil next time.\n\n\n-Jason",

And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it.\nCase in point. We're currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY.

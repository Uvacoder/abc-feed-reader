It was born out of my frustration with the many obstacles to achieving design that’s usable and equitable; protects people’s privacy, agency, and focus; benefits society; and restores nature. I argued that we need to overcome the inconveniences that prevent us from acting ethically and that we need to elevate design ethics to a more practical level by structurally integrating it into our daily work, processes, and tools.\nUnfortunately, we’re still very far from this ideal. \nAt the time, I didn’t know yet how to structurally integrate ethics.

This post is for RSS subscribers only.\nRead more about RSS Club.\n\nTwo years ago, Easter of 2020, I was chatting with some friends about crypto and one friend was starting to set aside some money and invest. Seemed harmless to do with “fun money”. We were in a pandemic after all, so no one was doing anything anyways. This was the height of the Gamestop and $DOGE meme stock market drama. I dismissed crypto at the time, but I used my Stocks app to follow the prices of $BTC, $ETH, $SOL, $DOGE, $SHIB, $LUNA, $XRP, $XTZ, and a some others that crossed my periphery field of view.\nYou see, it’s not hard to sell me on crypto. “Big banks, payday loans, and fees are problematic” = yes. “We can decentralize identity and web logins” = yes, cool. “We can decentralize payment” …",

But as I grow older a spectrum falls short for me in a couple different dimensions.\nTake color for instance. As kids we learned about the ROYGBIV visible spectrum of light, the zone between infrared light and ultraviolet light that most of us humans can see.\n\nThe rainbow, a naturally occurring ubiquitous concept. Children love rainbows. A light spectrum makes for a great science experiment or album cover.

          "description": "I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.\n\nMy favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.\nThe circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.\nSometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.\nTo top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.\nWhatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.",

Capture Handle allows a capturing web app to ergonomically and confidently identify the captured web app. (If the captured web app has opted-in.)\nA few examples illustrate the benefits.\nExample 1: If a video conferencing web app is capturing a presentation web app, the video conferencing web app can expose controls to the user for navigating between slides. Because the controls are embedded directly in the video conferencing web app, the user doesn’t have to repeatedly switch between the video conferencing tab and the presented tab. With this burden lifted, the user is now free to concentrate more fully on the delivery of their presentation.\nExample 2: The \"hall of …",

          "description": "I've finally become proficient with Tailwind CSS.\nHowever, my sites still look ok. I've adopted the idea of \"use different shades gray to make UIs\" and, as a result, my sites look... professional but uninviting.\nConsider sites like:\n- https://curius.app/\n- https://www.notion.so/\n- https://www.focusmate.com/\nThese sites look warm and inviting. Being proficient with Tailwind CSS just helps me have good padding, margins, and a reasonable default color scheme. It doesn't help me make my site look... human.\nI feel like I need a \"design palette\" instead of a mere \"color/margin palette\". What's the recommendation for this?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31317653\nPoints: 7\n# Comments: 2",

It starts with our new homepage  where we have a more complete representation of Bootstrap’s features and an updated design.\n\n\nThe docs sidebar navigation has been overhauled to have always expanded groups for easier browsing, a brand new DocSearch experience with search history, and new responsive offcanvas drawers for both sidebar and navbar on mobile.\n\n\n\n\nWe even updated our version picker in the navbar to cross-link between minor releases!\n\n\nUpdated buttons and inputs…",

          "description": "After several months, we’ve finally shipped Bootstrap v4.6.2, one of our last releases for the v4. It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.\nRead on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.\nWhat’s changed\nThere are two big highlights in v4.6.2:\nFirst, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.\nSecond, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.\nBeyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:\nTweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).\nImproved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.\nFixed some broken links to supporting documentation.\nUpdated dependencies across the board.\nReview the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.\nFrom here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.\nSupport the team\nVisit our Open Collective page or our team members’ GitHub profiles to help support the maintainers contributing to Bootstrap.",

          "description": "Dave Rupert recently published a post expressing his frustration with the urgent case for action on climate change, and lack of co-ordinated policy action by the people in power. While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.\nDave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.\nI agree that widespread societal ch…",

          "description": "Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:\n/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\nIf, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:\nWe could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-right: 2rem;\n  padding-left: 2rem;\n}\nWe could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding: 1rem 2rem;\n}\nI’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:\n.box {\n  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  --px: 2rem;\n}\nOn the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)\nSo instead we could write:\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-inline: 2rem;\n}\nCodepen demo →\nThe same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!\nLogical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.",

Masonry layout, in case you’re not aware, is where different height items are laid out in columns but, rather than being aligned on the row axis, the items below effectively move up to plug any gaps, kind of like a bricklayer — hence the name. Pinterest’s grid design is a commonly-cited example whenever the masonry conversation comes up.\nThe current state of masonry in CSS\nCurrently we can build a kind of faux-masonry (or “fakesonry”, if you will) layout in CSS by using columns.\n.list {\n  columns: 20rem;\n  column-gap: 1rem;\n}\nSee the Pen \n  Masonry grid (Firefox with flag enabled) by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nThis will create a layout t…",

          "description": "I’m not dying, but before I do I want to share with you — future generations of rockers — what I know about putting on a live music rock show.\nThe audience’s energy will match your energy. If you stand like a turd on the stage, they audience will stand like a bunch of turds. If you bob your head, they’ll bob their heads. If you move around, they’ll move around. If you show low confidence, they’ll have low confidence in you and start checking out.\nDon’t let your band drama show on stage. Every band has drama, but don’t let it show on stage. The audience isn’t there for that.\nPractice setting up and tearing down efficiently. Don’t make the audience wait and don’t be “that guy” who drags out setup extra long as some weirdo passive-aggressive attention seeking move. See previous rule.\nNo matter how big the stage, setup as close to each other as possible. Look and feel like a combined unit of people making music. Trust me, it will be more impressive.\nThe bassist and the drummer should stand next to each other. It’s all about the bass guitar and the kick drum locking in together.\nNever leave the van unattended during load-in or load-out. If you haven’t had your gear stolen at this point, it’s a miracle.\nLead guitar gets the attention, but the bass guitar brings the sex. Flashy medleys get attention, but people feel the bass, no matter how boring.\nDon’t riff stage banter. It’s hard to be witty on the fly unless you are very, very witty. Have some prepared goofs or smalltalk.\nMake friends with the soundboard operator. This person ultimately controls how good you sound and can make or break you.\n“Come forward to the stage” is at best a one-time suggestion. You can’t control people, never ask more than once.",

          "description": "Hi I can find easily courses books with technicalities of spark and technologies .\nWhat I cannot find are good courses for designing meaning for choosing partition keys, folder structure, pipeline stages (do you want a cleanup phase and when not etc).\nHere is a good random post I found https://www.google.com/amp/s/hub.packtpub.com/common-big-data-design-patterns/amp/\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Typical-four-layered-big-data-architecture-ingestion-processing-storage-and_fig1_329368513\nIs there something better than such random posts like books courses? All I find is courses that are either too low level with technicalities or top high levels.\nYeah I know there is the data intensive applications I read it and it's not dealing with these specific design decisions its more of 40 k feel look.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32287084\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "TapeMeasure is a utility class, written in Swift, for generating a visual tape measure, or any other graphical elements that need layout in a measured sequence.\nI created this class to help with a pet project I'm working on, where I needed to generate segmented, labeled lines to use as axes on charts and graphs. It occurred to me that this seems to be a pretty common task, involving a lot of boilerplate code and tedious calculations. Why not decouple the code and move it into a dedicated class? It's self-contained, nice and simple, and easy to unit test.\nIt can also handle a lot of tweaks to the \"tape measure\", such as boundary clipping and shifting offsets. It's especially good for animation, where you can just change a parameter or two during animation, and call for the re-calculated data to re-render your measured line. That makes it great for animated sliding and scaling effects.\nAnyway, enjoy!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32279795\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "So here we go, our rebranding is done. New logo, new domain, what could go wrong.\nWe provide a tool to convert design files between Figma, XD, Sketch, Figma, PDF and more and have recently rebranded it from \"XD2Sketch\" to \"Magicul\". We started out as a simple tool to allow users to import XD files in Sketch hence the name XD2Sketch but soon added more features. The name just didn't make sense anymore. Magicul initially seemed to be a great name, but turned out to be a bit of an interesting pick when translated to French.\nWe've sent out a newsletter to our customers to let them know about the changes and here's what one of our users replied:\nHey folks,\nWhile I understand that you guys probably hope to operate primarily in English, I think it needs to be mentioned that your brand name \"Magicul\" in french, literally means \"Magical ass\"... but the real kicker is the .io of the domain, which literally means input & output...\nSo here goes the bad news... The entire french community is reading your brand name - literally - as: Magical ass (dot) in & out.\nAnd then there's the logo itself... which is a hole with a hat.\nChrist. You can't make this stuff up. This is ugh, umm, a brutally unfortunate brand?...lol\nI'm in Quebec, Canada, where french is dominant and so I'm keenly aware of this - and so are my partners, colleagues and friends. We all had a good laugh.\nDon't know what else to say...?\nBonne chance mes amis!\nHave a good one,\n- A fan of your work in Montreal.\nYou can checkout our website here: https://magicul.io\nI just thought this was too hilarious to not share.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32276120\nPoints: 134\n# Comments: 81",

          "description": "I'm still quite early in my career, only at my second SW Dev job. My previous position was a monolith app with arguably poor design resulting in large parts of the app being very tightly coupled when they shouldn't be. Obviously this make testing some parts of the app very difficult  and of course those were the critical parts of them app (our integration test suite took over 24 hours to run at one point).\nWhen I joined my current company they were in the process of breaking down their monolith into micro services which based on my work at my previous position seemed like a much better alternative. After some time here I feel like I'm unsure whether or not micro services are as amazing as they need to be but I'm currently chalking it up to my inexperience with them. It seems like there needs to be a balance of making sure that each service has a limited responsibility while also not having services too interdependent.\nSo basically I would like to learn more about good design practices and pitfalls to avoid. What resources have you guys used to learn more about micro services?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32250823\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.\nI did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I'm trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.\nWhat could I have done differently?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32022275\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I'm looking for resources/tips on how to learn concepts in system design. Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I'd also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.\nIn terms of what I've done so far...\nI've read\n- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.\n- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It's been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.\n- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I've really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.\nI'd really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.\nThank you very much!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32014658\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.\nIt also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it's easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don't want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.\nI miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.\nIn my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.\nIt makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it's UI/UX hasn't changed (In major ways) for many years?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31991675\nPoints: 60\n# Comments: 87",

The gallery and musician could put out a feed which I could follow, with values including date-time, address, info-url, ticket-url, details. My event-feed reader would pull in the gallery's and musician's events from their website, and populate a calendar with them. Moreover, I could set the reader to only display events in the region I care about, so the only gigs of the musician that would appear would be the ones when they come to my town.\nThey seems a simple, decentralised way of following events, but I'm surprised nothing like this already exists?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32304474\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I aimed the site to be for people like me, so no telemetry and minimal JS was the goal. I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I've thought you folk might be interested.\nNot sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.\nIf you're lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32193896\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 13",

It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.\nWith this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.\nToday, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.\nOur team will be answering all your questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135638\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

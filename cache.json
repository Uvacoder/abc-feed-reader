          "description": "The final four are here! The course on responsive design I wrote for web.dev is now complete, just in time for Christmas. The four new modules are:\nAccessibility\nUser interface patterns\nMedia features\nScreen configurations\nThese four felt quite “big picture”, and often quite future-facing. I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens. That felt like a fitting way to close out the course, bookending it nicely with the history of responsive design in the introduction.\nAnd with that, the full course is now online. Go forth and learn responsive design!",

          "description": "Last month I wrote about writing on web.dev. At that time, the first five parts of a fifteen-part course on responsive design had been published. I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:\nTypography\nResponsive images\nThe picture element\nIcons\nTheming\nIt wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.\nThe final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.",

It’s as if Disney had announced that they’d found the footage for a film shot between Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back.\nStill, does this treasure trove really warrant the daunting length of this new Beatles documentary? As Terence puts it:\nThere are two problems with this Peter Jackson documentary. The first is that it is far too long - are casual fans really going to sit through 9 hours of a band bickering? The second problem is that it is far too short!

As I wrote in the responsive design course on web.dev, they’re crucial for internationalisation.\nAlaa Abd El-Rahim has written articles on CSS tricks about building multi-directional layouts and controlling layout in a multi-directional website. Not having to write separate stylesheets—or even separate rules—for different writing modes is great!\nMore than that though, I think understanding logical properties is the best way to truly understand CSS layout tools like grid and flexbox.\nIt’s like when you’re learning a new language. At some point your brain goes from translating from your mother tongue into the other language, and instead starts thinking in that other language. Likewise with CSS, as some point you want to stop translating “left” and “rig…",

The reading voice for most web pages is American accent, but when it reads @CSSInRealLife, it switches to British, which is very interesting.😁\n— CY is here 👩🏻‍💻🚀🖖🏻 (@cyishere) November 29, 2021\n \nI replied that I thought this was likely due to the page’s lang attribute, which on this site is en-GB — British English. The default for many frameworks is en, American English. While there might not be huge differences between the two, it can affect how certain words are pronounced to assistive technologies such as screenreaders. (You can read more about the lang attribute on MDN.) Of course, it would have a much bigger impact on web pages that are in a different language altogether, so you should always make sure you change it to the appropriate value!\nThe experience shared by @cyishere serves an important reminder that people browse the web in all sorts of ways we might not be aware of when building our sites, and we should make sure we build with that flexibility in mind. While it’s easy to see this unknowability as a hindrance, I believe that it’s something to be embraced. In building for the web, we have the opportunity to deliver content to users in a way that suits them, and the web platform provides us with all sorts of features in HTML and CSS that help us do that. Starting with semantic HTML and layering on top with progressive enhancement is a solid strategy.\nSpeaking of the lang attribute reminded me of Manuel Matuzović’s excellent article analysing his HTML boilerplate. It contains tons of useful information about many of the elements and attributes most of us don’t give much thought to day-to-day if, like Manuel, we recycle the same boilerplate from project to project. It’s well worth a read.",

The maintainers are too busy or too burnt out to get the project back on track.\nMy open source burnout saga is pretty standard. My coworkers and I made a jQuery plugin that solved a hole in the web platform. It got pretty popular, and we made another one, and another one.

The procedure involved cutting away 1mm layers of flesh at the tumor site and looking at each layer under a microscope, repeating the process until there’s no cancer detected. Thankfully we got it in one go. But because this is my nose, you can’t graft a piece of butt cheek on there to patch it up, we had to borrow skin from other parts of my nose and sew it all up. It looks like I got into a fight, but it seems to have gone well. Still don’t know what the final product will look like, but I’m glad it’s over for now becuase that was a lot of ambient anxiety hanging over me.\nEarlier in the month, the app I’m working on had a big 10-day outa…",

          "description": "In 2013 Chong-U Lim wrote a research paper for MIT wordily titled Modeling Player Performance in Avatar Customization Using Social Network Data: A Case Study Using Virtual Items in Team Fortress 2. It’s all about the correlation between in-game loot —digital items people win or buy on the Steam marketplace— and player’s social status in an online competitive game called Team Fortress 2. What a phenomenal research topic! It’s a dense paper, so thankfully Tommy Thompson at the AI & Games YouTube channel breaks it down.\nOne interesting piece was how the study talks about players creating a “phantasmal identity” —a projection of real-world human ideas onto a digital avatar— and how the player’s identity is often projected in a “ridiculous and exaggerated fashion”. A machine learning model was able to classify and predict (with ~60% accuracy) a player’s social status (social interactions) based on their status performance (value of in-game hats). I think about this often, because it’s a fascinating look at the relationship between digital cosmetics (hats, skins, avatars, sprays) and social status broadcasting.

It’s made it an unenjoyable place for me as more and more people I follow chase the money over to Web3. Everything is getting an NFT feature: Twitter, Discord, Reddit, Disney+, Star Trek; it’s exhausting.\nI spent a lot of time and emotional well-being last month thinking (aka “doing my own research”) about Web3 and NFTs. I’m not morally opposed to ledger-like problems that blockchain can solve and DAOs even sound great; but the surface area for criminal activity, unregulated markets, no consumer protection, fake scarcity to drive up values, low-quality art being cheaply made selling at inflated values, thousands of 500 watt GPUs glowing in a basement in Iowa destroying the environment for a profile picture… Ugh.\nNFTs are sucking the air out of everything… both literally and figuratively.\nTwo weeks ago I uninstalled Twitter from my devices. Waking up in the morning I’m no longer greeted with a million angry voices. No faux conservative outrage, no reactive liberal outrage. It can all be undone in an instant, but right now I’m unplugged from the infernal machine and it feels unsettingly quiet.",

Very hard. Guess it's due to security.\nAfter some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.\nFear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.\nUpload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.\nThe other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.\nAm I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer?

This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.\nI've seen several submissions by HNers working on 'friendlier' social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.\nThis seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I've tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29506095\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "We are designing Identity and Access management for our Application. \nWe have different org using our app. Each org may have some sub orgs. Users belong to one or more sub orgs.\nA user can have different roles in each sub org.\nE.g a user U1 belong to Org O1 / Sub Org SB1 and Org O1 / Sub Org SB2.\nNow user can have Admin role in SB1 and Non-Admin role in SB2.\nNow when a U1 logins, user needs to select which sub org he wants to operate in and accordingly all roles will be fetched.\nIn standard RBAC, we can link user to multiple roles but that will give user all permissions in all those roles. In our case we want to ties user to multiple roles but those roles exist in different contexts SB1 and SB2. So we do not want combined evaluation of permissions from both roles.\nAlso we want to define permissions assigned to each role at one place only.\nIs there any proven extensible design to serve these kind of use cases?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29459196\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

But at my full time job it's not always possible due to different reasons =\\\nSo I've been posting random UI/UX staff on Twitter, then I made a free book that had 50 tips (posted it here as well).\nI decided to finish this year by collecting everything I learned and here it is: https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips.\nThis time it's a paid one. But, you can check ~20 pages of it, just go to https://akcium.gumroad.com/l/ui-ux-tips-sample, put 0 in the price and download it for free.\nI tried to illustrate almost every tip and provide some additional links.\nThis is especially useful for devs and founders who cannot afford a designer or just want to make their UI look decent.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29437527\nPoints: 189\n# Comments: 30",

          "description": "Historically, RS has nodes and slices. One node made of a given number of slices (varies by node type). Data is distributed over slices, and only the slice holding a block can access that block.\nThese days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.\nSo I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 ins…",

I spend so much time searching for the actual content on most pages because there are so many links to other crap.\nFor example, check out this Betty Crocker page where there's about 300px of whitespace at the top, a huge useless picture of flour, and a navbar that doesn't quite stick to the top of the page (viewing on Firefox) https://www.bettycrocker.com/how-to/tipslibrary/charts-timetables-measuring/equivalent-measures-abbreviations\nAnother example is allrecipes.com. I think it fares pretty well on Desktop, but on my phone I notice they insert adds throughout the ingredient list and instructions. Also met with a full-screen popup from Amazon about Cyber Monday.\nThere's gotta be some plain and simple sites out there, and I'd like to hear about them.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29387511\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 4",

Skip the second half of the book when the chapters switch to being real world examples\n3. Having trouble on a particular section? Watch the youtube video to get a cleaner read: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22hwcnXIGgk&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DX6ic0HGT0PUX_wiNmkWkXx\n4. Don't spend too much time on NP/NP-Complete/NP-Hard topics\n5. Over learn chapter 2. This is arguably the most important chapter having a deep understanding of runtime analysis helps you in every other chapter and on the interview\n6. Don't spend too much time on writing proofs in Chapter 1. Understand them and be able to work through them and understand how the math comes together, but writing a specific proof isn't too valuable. \n7. Sometimes the interview problems at the end of the chapter are silly. If it feels dumb, example: 1.36. How much does the ice in a hockey rink weigh? Skip it. These are older school programming interview questions and have been largely phased out\nUltimately I feel like this book is the best resource for big tech interview prep, and I want to help my students spend their time as efficiently as possible. If anyone has additional advice or feedback on how I can improve this list, I'd love to hear it.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29369624\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I've been working with web testing frameworks (Selenium and its wrappers / Cypress / Puppeteer / Playwright / others) for the last few years, but I asked myself what \"frameworks of the future\" should look like. I found myself not wanting things too wild or different from what we have today - just incremental improvements. Is that objectively true? What, if anything, is the next leap forward? Or are we close to them being \"good enough\" for the most part?\nMy top \"problems\", in some shape or form, from existing products:\n- Be faster to complete builds\n- Have fewer false positives (or do accurate self-healing magic)\n- Be easier to get started with (or be optionally codeless like Selenium IDE)\n- Don't be a walled garden (what if I want to run the same logical 'test' across Playwright and Cypress)\n- Help me write better tests (or be difficult to write bad tests within)\n- Emulate mobile devices better than just viewport modification\nWhat do the HN folks think?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29329713\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hello HN:\nI have been developing apps for iOS and Android for about 10 years. Started with Objective C and Java and then moved to Swift and Kotlin. I don't have much web dev experience though (mostly vanilla JS) but do have lots of mobile dev and backend dev experience in node js and bit of Rust.\nHave you switched from native to cross platform dev?\nHave you tried both flutter and react native?\nWhich one did you prefer and why?\nThanks!\nEdit: I did start learning flutter yesterday and it seems pretty decent so far. 2 problems I do have are:\n1. Too must nesting (which some say can be solved by breaking down everything into smaller widgets but seems like a lot of extra code work).\n2. Flutter for web dev is absolute trash and useless as it seems to just draw the content using canvas instead of actually creating the html tree.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29357432\nPoints: 15\n# Comments: 8",

We can get by with VSCode doing livereload on a single machine or liveshare on multiple machines, but not both because Univ IT blocks liveshare's public port broadcast. Teaching them Git would burn 1-2 class sessions, but might be worth it -- not sure.\nIs there a way to satisfy these reqs?\n1. Provides live-sharing (2+ students code from separate machines in the same file)\n2. Supports auto-reload on each machine without public port binding (Univ IT blocks port broadcast)\n3. Is an IDE or IDE extension\n4. Keeps some sort of version history\n5. Syncs a local copy of the files on each machine* (nice to have)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29416891\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Last week we hosted our 6th React Conf.  In previous years, we’ve used the React Conf stage to deliver industry changing announcements such as React Native and React Hooks. This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.\nThis was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.\nAll the talks are available to stream online.\nHere’s a summary of what was shared on stage:\n\nReact 18 and concurrent fea…",

These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.",

I honestly did find the amount of sex in the book kind of over the top. I can buy that Kvothe is a legend character and one part of that is perhaps he has a reputation with women, but I'm not wholely sure I needed the many-month-long shagathon story when Kvothe is away with the faeries…\nStill, even with this, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for as long as I could.\nThe very ending, like the last few pages of The Name of the Wind did surprise me a left me a little confused, but I like to think that one day The Doors of Stone will answer some of those questions…",

Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.\nThe key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them.

And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\nSo what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them.

          "description": "That we manage all our programming projects in Basecamp is perhaps an obvious admission since its our own product. But it's less obvious to some how that's possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can't seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn't tied together?\nThe simple answer is: don't. You don't need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That'…",

There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren't deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn't shipping. And shipping is what counts.\nThat's a hard ethos to live by! It's so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it's an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.\nWe've been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we'd make a promise, which we occasionally couldn't keep. It sucks.\nBut the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It's addicting! Yes, it's a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.\nBe a real artist. Ship.",

At-work encryption, as we call it on the HEY security page.\nBut it's on the front end things have made a quantum leap. We've integrated the Hotwire frameworks of Stimulus and Turbo directly as the new defaults, together with that hot newness of import maps, which means you no longer need to run the whole JavaScript ecosystem enchilada in your Ruby app.\nTurbo traces its roots back to 2012 with the first release of its predecessor Tur…",

When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE'S A TAKE, THERE'S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it's a sliver of that.\nBut it goes even deeper than that. When there's no public outlet for all the possible takes, I've found that fewer takes actually develop. That it's possible to see a story float by and go \"I don't need or want to assume even a mental position on this\". It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.\nThis is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…",

The echoes of history provide a strange comfort: We are not the first people to be struggling with this.\nI don't just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.\nWilliam Buckley's show The Firing Line is a treasure trove in this regard.

I've listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn't have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan's, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?\nSuch basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days.

Not because of some innate animosity with JavaScript, at least not the modern variety, which we first tasted in the form of CoffeeScript, then as transpiled ES Next. But because writing and updating HTML like that never felt like an appropriate solution for the kind of apps I was interested in writing.\nSuch resistance to the proliferation of JavaScripting Everything turned into a minority position in years past.

          "description": "The first speakers are live on the UX London 2022 site! There are only five people announced for now—just enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. There will be many, many more.\nPutting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.\nI’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…\nThe first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.\nThe second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …",

If I win, that money goes to the Bletchley Park Trust. If Matt wins, it goes to The Internet Archive.\nI’m very happy to lose this bet.\nWhen I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web.

Like everyone else running conferences, we had to pivot in the face of The Situation.\nIn hindsight, it’s remarkable how well those online events went. This was new territory for everyone—speakers, attendees, and organisers.\nUX Fest was a real highlight. I had the pleasure of hosting the event, giving it my Woganesque best. It was hard work, but it paid off.\nStill, it’s not quite the same as gathering together with your peers in one place for a shared collective experience. I’ve really been missing in-person events (and from what I’ve seen in people’s end-of-year blog posts, I’m not alone).\nThat’s why I’m absolutely thrilled that UX London is back in 2022!

Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.\nAt this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week.

It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine.

In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:\nThe very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.\nThat’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.\nI’d like to get…",

There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.\nWeb Performance And The Planet\nFershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.\nWatch Fershad’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nBuilding a Greener Web\nMy own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.\nWatch the talk →\nSee the slides →\nThe Carbon Footprint of Images\nJon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.\nWatch Jon’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nYou might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!",

That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30422517\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.\nShe did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it's just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I'm 100% biased): https://kevin.tw\nFun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn't have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30344989\nPoints: 788\n# Comments: 158",

To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main \"erpnext\" account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!\nI am a pretty proficient user and I wasn't drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.\nMy feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than \"Feedback\". To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.\nIf any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30164146\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).\nAnd it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!\nYou can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.\nBy the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30373847\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "I suck at CSS. There, I said it.\nI've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.\nI understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.\nI've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.\nInstead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.\nOk, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?\nI must be missing something, right?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355757\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 20",

If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what's happening on it. If I'm working on a problem and I'm not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).\nI don't like the habit, but I have it.\nI used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.\nThere are two directions I can go in (I think):\n1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)\n2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).\nDoes anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?\nDoes anyone have any success getting more comfortable \"holding\" the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik's cube?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30245071\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "With 2021 the worst year for worker productivity, it has to be asked: is this largely because work-from-home isn't working out?\nWe can find lots of excuses (resignations; worker malaise; economic decline) but isn't most of that laid right back at the door of work-from-home?\nWhen just a few are involved it may be viable. But I'm beginning to think, it will never fly to have almost everybody staying home. Something critical about the work environment gets broken, when nobody is minding the shop.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30116878\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 2",

I was wrong, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge!\n\nOpening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:\n\nPins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:\n\nAnd now the Gameboy boots with a nice clean Nintendo logo. Except… it doesn't go past that point at all - and in fact the screen looks like it's doing some weird flash dance, goi…",

I'm now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.\nAnd personally speaking, I'm just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.\nI'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.\nAnd I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.\nStay tuned.",

Nearly 400 people applied for the position.\nAs applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.\nI wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant's permission, although it's been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren't comfortable sharing publicly.\nBeyond it being an exceptionally good application — you'll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job.

It can't be long before the fingers start pointing in his direction.\nBut I can see how he's been able to slide past the professionally outraged class of media watchers so far. I mean, look at him! He's the anti-Rogan persona from afar. Dressed like hippie, pontificating like a poet. Stepped in an ethos of peace, love, and harmony.

That's everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow Shape Up).\nThis approach isn't entirely without trade-offs.

          "description": "I'd been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since retiring from the back-and-forth, it's clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.\nThis is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I'd be surprised if you aren't aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it's a shock to the system.\nThat shock isn't the problem, though. It's the solution. It's your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, producing everything from ulcers to heart disease.\nI think most people already know this, but I don't think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn't be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries. That's a longitudinal study I'd love to see.

It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It's quite literally a creative force.\nWhen you're focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.\nThis is the wisdom of the Mark Twain's etiquette \"never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company\". Specifically the point about \"polite company\". It's the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.\nAll this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People's religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. \nToday social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people's stances on the thorniest issues. It's often hard not to know someone's leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.\nBut it's worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget.

          "description": "Here's what you can't say on a podcast hosted by Spotify about Covid, per the company's internal moderation policy:\n\nContent that promotes dangerous false or deceptive content about healthcare that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health such as:\nDenying the existence of AIDS or COVID-19\nEncouraging the deliberate contracting of a serious or life threatening disease or illness\nSuggesting that consuming bleach can cure various illnesses and diseases\nSuggesting that wearing a mask will cause the wearer imminent, life-threatening physical harm\nPromoting or suggesting that the vaccines are designed to cause death\n\n\nWhat an impressively clear and concise policy! Focused primarily on the concrete \"imminent threat\" principle. Thus making it clear whether a violation ha…",

          "description": "What's stood out most to me about the latest Rogan round over Neil Young's ultimatum is the iron-clad assumption that Spotify surely must – MUST! – agree with the underlying premise. That Rogan is a menace to society because he host guests with divergent views on covid, and because he shares his unsanctioned opinion on the matter. Therefore, the only reason they're not yanking him is fear. Fear of losing subscribers, money, marketshare, whatever. It can't possibly be due to a genuine disagreement with the menace-to-society charge.\nJonathan Haidt talks about this in The Righteous Mind:\n\nMorality binds and blinds. It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle. It blinds us to the fact that each team is compos…",

          "description": "Social media platforms have been on relentless quest since their inception to remove all friction from all acts of engagement. The distance from emotion to reaction has been whittled away one A/B test at the time, and there's barely any left. You don't even have to portray any original sentiment today, just like or retweet that of someone else, and you'll be microdosing on that sweet rush of belonging.\nWe know it too! Celebrate it, even! Have you seen that new thing that just went viral? SAVAGE. Yes, this level of virulent spread is savage. Because it's literally been engineered in a lab to be so. All our natural human defenses have been studied by machines learning, and are now effectively and consistently evaded. No wonder this meta virus has taken over key parts of society.\nBut you know…",

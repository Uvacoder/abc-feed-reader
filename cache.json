          "description": "It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.\nStill, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.\nIn 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.\nIt all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.\nThe far mor…",

With science!\nWhenever someone writes and shares one of these year-end retrospectives the result is, by its very nature, personal. These last two years are different though. We all still have our own personal perspectives, but we also all share a collective experience of The Ongoing Situation.\nLike, I can point to three pivotal events in 2021 and I bet you could point to the same three for you:\ngetting my first vaccine shot in March,\ngetting my second vaccine shot in June, and\ngetting my booster shot in December.\nSo while on the one hand we’re entering 2022 in a depressingly similar way to how we entered 2021 with COVID-19 running rampant, on the other…",

About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.\nI continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.\nNow that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…",

I certainly learned a lot researching proposals for potential media features and foldable screens.

I’m pleased to say that the next five parts are now available. They are:\nTypography\nResponsive images\nThe picture element\nIcons\nTheming\nIt wasn’t planned, but these five modules feel like they belong together. The first five modules were concerned with layout tools—media queries, flexbox, grid, and even container queries. The latest five modules are about the individual elements of design—type, colour, and images. But those elements are examined through the lens of responsiveness; responsive typography with clamp, responsive colour with prefers-color-scheme, and responsive images with picture and srcset.\nThe final five modules should be available later this month. In the mean time, I hope you like the first ten modules.",

Like Hidde, I prefer not to dwell too much on the negatives for these end-of-year posts. Suffice to say, in another pandemic year, there have been plenty of lows as well as highs.\nCSS\nThere hasn’t been one single new CSS feature in 2021 that’s captured my attention above all others. But CSS continues to evolve and keep pace with developers’ needs. It’s great to see browsers coming through with widespread support for aspect-ratio. I’ve been using min(), max() and clamp() a lot more now that they’re widely supported, and finding them super convenient.

          "description": "Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:\nsection:has(img) {\n  background: lightgray;\n}\nBut eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.\nYou could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:\nform:has(input:invalid) {\n  border: 2px solid red;\n}\nThe parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.\nIt’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():\n@supports selector(:has(*)) {\n  .info,\n  .warning {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\nOn a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.",

          "description": "I'm building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software's API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.\nI'm having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I'm certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I'd like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.\nThe problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don't see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.\nIn a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that's not an option.\nIs my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29710441\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I have just tried to get my access back to my bank account.\nSince I switch numbers frequently due to moving countries, 2FA is hell for me.\nTo get my account back I need a selfie with both my face and ID visible. Very hard. Guess it's due to security.\nAfter some hours wasted I got it done. Time to transfer the file. Of course gmail does not send my email.\nFear not, I am smarter than that. Upload to Drive. Nope, does not work either. Weird.\nUpload with facebook messenger maybe? Hmm they compress images like hell.\nThe other day fiverr was not loading orders for like a day. Wise.com turned chinese for no reason. Google cloud resets my functions to private randomly.\nAm I losing my mind? Getting old? Too busy? Frustrated? Am I just a shitty developer? How do non techies cope?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29636149\nPoints: 31\n# Comments: 36",

This is obviously not great when a lot of public discourse (or attempts at it) happen on these platforms.\nI've seen several submissions by HNers working on 'friendlier' social media platforms, but is there academic research being done on what features would constitute a human-centric social media? By human-centric I mean a space designed to encourage thoughtful communication, to the extent that it can, and one that does not exploit the properties of human brains to form addictions to said platform.\nThis seems like it ought to be an active area of research. I've tried googling, but all that comes up for the terms I can think of is articles on how to use social media for marketing.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29506095\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 1",

For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it's really swings and roundabouts.\nI recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.\nThis post is mostly data driven (from my own web site's data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I've read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.",

          "description": "Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.\nOnly right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of \"millennium type problems\". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!\nThe Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.\nFor me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).\nBut what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither \"he\" or \"she\", so Chamber's settles with using the \"they\" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.\nThe sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with \"it\" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is \"they\". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.\nI do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.",

These two characters together made it rather difficult to want to keep reading their story, but I'm glad I did persevere.Although the story is a little cliche, around four fifths the way through the book, it does a pretty good job to win me over to the main characters and I want to see them happy by the end of the story.Probably a little bit too long, but worth it for the payoff at the end.",

We think reading this report is the clearest way to understand what problems we are working on, how they fit into our plan for solving alignment in the worst case, and our research methodology.\nThe core difficulty we discuss is learning how to map between an AI’s model of the world and a human’s model. This is closely related to ontology identification (and other similar statements). Our main contribution is to present many possible approaches to the problem and a more precise discussion of why it seems to be difficult and important.\nThe report is available here as a google document. If you're excited about this research, we're hiring!\nQ&A\nWe're particularly excited about answering questions posted here throughout December. We welcome any questions no matter how basic or confused; we would love to help people understand what research we’re doing and how we evaluate progress in enough detail that they could start to do it themselves.\nThanks to María Gutiérrez-Rojas for the illustrations in this piece (the good ones, blame us for the ugly diagrams).

Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.\nThe key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them.

And let’s be honest, these might be the same goals you had at the top of your list last year, am I right?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\n\n\nSo what prevented you from reaching your goals? How will this year be different? Sometimes, the difference between success and failure is simply in the approach. The reason most people abandon their resolutions by mid-February is because their goals were too vague, too overwhelming and lacked a realistic plan. The truth is the approach failed, not them.

Part of me is excited to write this email to you, and the other part feels vulnerable and exposed as I officially introduce the book to the world.\n\n\nI sold this latest title Feb 23, 2020. I thought this topic was important then. Three weeks later we went into quarantine. I couldn’t imagine the impact it would have across the board, but specifically in how we viewed our friendships.

Perhaps it’s people running long distances with huge packs on their backs. Perhaps we think about it from a workplace perspective, of pushing ourselves to be better, more educated in our professional lives.\n\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind however, probably isn’t training our mind. Our brain is one of the most important parts of our body so why don’t we make the effort to train it? Like our muscles, our brain becomes more resilient and pliable the more we work on it.\n\n\nThink about when you get physically injured after not warming up.

          "description": "Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.\n\nDuring the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.\n\nThere are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.\n\nIt’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.\n\nThis is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.\n\nRemember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it's never right even after.\n\nIn the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!\n\n\n-Jason",

Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I'm just left thinking: What's the point? Do people think this is a lottery?\nThis isn't unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don't even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?\nMaybe that's part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don't even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I'm skeptical.\nEither way, it's not how we review applications at Basecamp. There's a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don't comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a \"manager of managers\" for the director of engineering).\nYou might think, what's the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that's it. But I think there's a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I'm not getting callbacks, so I'll put even less effort into the next opening.\nI guess what I'm saying is make the effort or don't bother.

It could be worse, you could have died!\nIt wasn't just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control.

It's closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality.

While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren't deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn't shipping. And shipping is what counts.\nThat's a hard ethos to live by! It's so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it's an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.\nWe've been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we'd make a promise, which we occasionally couldn't keep. It sucks.\nBut the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It's addicting! Yes, it's a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.\nBe a real artist. Ship.",

The culmination of years of progress on five different fronts at once.\nThe backend gets some really nice upgrades, especially with the encryption work that we did for HEY, so your data can be encrypted while its live in the database. At-work encryption, as we call it on the HEY security page.\nBut it's on the front end things have made a quantum leap. We've integrated the Hotwire frameworks of Stimulus and Turbo directly as the new defaults, together with that hot newness of import maps, which means you no longer need to run the whole JavaScript ecosystem enchilada in your Ruby app.\nTurbo traces its roots back to 2012 with the first release of its predecessor Tur…",

          "description": "The most liberating aspect for me of writing emails rather than tweets is the natural limit on topics I might be tempted to have a take on. When I was primarily writing tweets, I could easily involve myself in a dozen topics in a day. HERE'S A TAKE, THERE'S A TAKE, TAKE THAT! With email, it's a sliver of that.\nBut it goes even deeper than that. When there's no public outlet for all the possible takes, I've found that fewer takes actually develop. That it's possible to see a story float by and go \"I don't need or want to assume even a mental position on this\". It feels like the olden days, before we were all mined for opinions all day long by the platforms of engagement and enragement.\nThis is a helpful constriction in general, especially if you, like me, have a natural tendency to spontane…",

          "description": "In trying to understand the ideology of The Elect, as John McWorter calls them, I've found a historical dive into the late 60s and early 70s tremendously productive. The echoes of history provide a strange comfort: We are not the first people to be struggling with this.\nI don't just mean that in a general sense. That other peoples at other times have faced crippling polarization, societal upheaval, and political distress. No, that the very battlegrounds of thought are the same. Not similar, but the same.\nWilliam Buckley's show The Firing Line is a treasure trove in this regard. Take this episode where he hosts Dotson Rader and Arnold Beichman in a discussion about the student revolutionaries, the radicalization process, class consciousness, and the general turmoil of the late 60s. It's rem…",

It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit.\n\nCommunities prior to the advent of coinage didn’t seek to set…",

          "description": "I can completely see why Joe Rogan's podcast has become so popular. I've listened to maybe a dozen shows, and the way he lets his guests talk, at length, feels like a throwback. It doesn't have the intellectualism of a Bryan Magee or the inquisitiveness of a William Buckley, but it does have the spirit of letting people – with whom he, his audience, and others might disagree – present their thoughts in full. In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan's, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?\nSuch basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days. On many of the most controversial issues, even partaking in a conversation with \"the other side\" is often derided as \"…",

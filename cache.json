          "description": "It’s said that the best way to learn about something is to teach it. I certainly found that to be true when I was writing the web.dev course on responsive design.\nI felt fairly confident about some of the topics, but I felt somewhat out of my depth when it came to some of the newer modern additions to browsers. The last few modules in particular were unexplored areas for me, with topics like screen configurations and media features. I learned a lot about those topics by writing about them.\nBest of all, I got to put my new-found knowledge to use! Here’s how…\nThe Session is a progressive web app. If you add it to the home screen of your mobile device, then when you launch the site by tapping on its icon, it behaves just like a native app.\nIn the web app manifest file for The Session, the dis…",

          "description": "It’s a bit of a cliché to talk about living in the future. It’s also a bit pointless. After all, any moment after the big bang is a future when viewed from any point in time before it.\nStill, it’s kind of fun when a sci-fi date rolls around. Like in 2015 when we reached the time depicted in Back To The Future 2, or in 2019 when we reached the time of Blade Runner.\nIn 2022 we are living in the future of web standards. Again, technically, we’re always living in the future of any past discussion of web standards, but this year is significant …in a very insignificant way.\nIt all goes back to 2008 and an interview with Hixie, editor of the HTML5 spec at the WHATWG at the time. In it, he mentioned the date 2022 as the milestone for having two completely interoperable implementations.\nThe far mor…",

With science!\nWhenever someone writes and shares one of these year-end retrospectives the result is, by its very nature, personal. These last two years are different though. We all still have our own personal perspectives, but we also all share a collective experience of The Ongoing Situation.\nLike, I can point to three pivotal events in 2021 and I bet you could point to the same three for you:\ngetting my first vaccine shot in March,\ngetting my second vaccine shot in June, and\ngetting my booster shot in December.\nSo while on the one hand we’re entering 2022 in a depressingly similar way to how we entered 2021 with COVID-19 running rampant, on the other…",

I don’t think I actually read any more than my usual annual allotment of words.\nI’m glad that I’m tracking my reading here on my own site. About halfway through the year I thought that I was doing a pretty good job of reading a mix of books from men and women, but a glance at my reading list showed that wasn’t the case at all and I was able to adjust my intake accordingly. I wasn’t doing as badly as some but by just keeping an ongoing reading list is a handy to spot any worrying trends.\nI continued my practice of alternating between fiction and non-fiction. It’s working for me.\nNow that the year is at an end, I’m going to my traditional round-up and give a little review of each book.…",

But CSS continues to evolve and keep pace with developers’ needs. It’s great to see browsers coming through with widespread support for aspect-ratio.

          "description": "Just a few days ago Safari gave us all an early Christmas present: the latest Safari Technology Preview release includes support for the :has() pseudo-class! Otherwise known as the “parent selector”, (but officially termed in the the spec ‘The Relational Pseudo-class’) it allows us to style an element based on its descendants. We can do things like (off the top of my head) style any sections that contain img elements:\nsection:has(img) {\n  background: lightgray;\n}\nBut eagle-eyed CSS aficionados might spot that it opens up way more possibilities than that, as Bramus writes in his blog post. He’s also been experimenting with form styling, including styling labels based on the validity of their inputs.\nYou could even style a whole form differently if it contains invalid inputs:\nform:has(input:invalid) {\n  border: 2px solid red;\n}\nThe parent selector is something the CSS world has been crying out for for some time, and I’m sure we’ll see lots more imaginative use cases come to light over the coming year.\nIt’s worth mentioning that you can test for support for :has() using feature queries with the selector() function, as detailed in this CSS Tricks post. Having never needed to use it before, this had completely passed me by, but it’s yet another cool CSS feature that’ll come in handy. Bramus uses it in his post to show or hide a warning message, depending on whether the browser supports :has():\n@supports selector(:has(*)) {\n  .info,\n  .warning {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\nOn a side note, it’s great to see Safari leading the way on new CSS features like :has(), after years of lagging behind — no doubt spearheaded by Jen Simmons’ presence on the team.",

          "description": "In Open UI there’s been some discussion about what default ARIA role the proposed <popupdialog> element should have, if any…\nThe proposed <popupdialog> element is a top-layer element that anchors to another element. Semantically, that’s a lot like a non-modal dialog, but people will probably use it incorrectly as a listbox, tooltip, combobox, etc. which are not a dialog and have their own more appropriate semantics. Should it be a dialog? Or should it be nothing like a <div> or a <span> but sits on the top layer of a website? Should we have other (similar) elements for those specific use cases? Is display: popup the best primitive here?\nAll good questions and I’m sure someone smarter than me will provide an answer.\nWhat struck me about it all was how ARIA wants to be specific. It asks elements “Who are you deep down in your soul?” It’s a sentry at the gate, asking elements to identify themselves and if the element belongs to or fits within the known lexicon then there are well-defined interaction patterns that work with the Assistive Technology. It’s all useful and makes sense if you consider aural interfaces.\nHTML, in my view, tends to be more general and permissive. A chill uncle. <div>? Sure, that can be a div. <article>? If you think that’s the article, great, let’s start there. <video>? Sure, send me some sources and I’ll do my best otherwise I’ll do nothing. Did you use a link for a <button> and a <button> for a link? Aww geeze, Rick. Wish you hadn’t done that. There’s right and wrong ways to do HTML, but there’s often more than one path to a solution. HTML provides a lot of building blocks, spicy divs and spicy spans, sometimes with built-in functionality and semantics, and other times the functionality it’s all bring-your-own.\nThere’s a tension there, but I think that’s what you get in a robust language designed to be liberal in what it accepts but conservative in what it does.",

Its usage in Chrome has declined\nsignificantly over the last year. SDES is\nremoved because it is a\nsecurity problem. It exposes session keys to Javascript, which means that\nentities with access to the negotiation exchange, or with the ability to subvert\nthe Javascript, can decrypt the media sent over the connection.\n# Deprecation policy\nTo keep the platform healthy, we sometimes remove APIs from the Web Platform\nwhich have run their course. There can be many reasons why we would remove an\nAPI, such as:\nThey are superseded by newer APIs.\nThey are updated to reflect changes to specifications to bring alignment and\nconsistency with other browsers.\nThey are early experiments that never came to fruition in other browsers and\nthus can increase the burden of support for web developers.\nSome of these changes will have an effect on a very small number of sites. To\nmitigate issues ahead of time, we try to give developers advanced notice so they\ncan make the required changes to keep their sites running.\nChrome currently has a process for deprecations and removals of\nAPI's,\nessentially:\nAnnounce on the\nblink-dev\nmailing list.\nSet warnings and give time scales in the Chrome DevTools Console when usage\nis detected on the page.\nWait, monitor, and then remove the feature as usage drops.\nYou can find a list of all deprecated features on chromestatus.com using the\ndeprecated filter and\nremoved features by applying the removed\nfilter.

          "description": "Over the years I've started many, many side projects and most of them were completed but never launched because I didn't like the way they looked and couldn't improve them.\nCommon advice for people like me is to use a framework and/or template. I've used bootstrap in the past which is fine for very simple apps, but I struggle with anything even remotely complicated. I've spent money on premium bootstrap themes but the end result never looks the way I imagined.\nI've also hired a couple of designers on odesk with no success. I showed them what I was working on and explained how it worked. I basically got back the same thing with different colors.\nIt's hard for me to express exactly what I find difficult. I see webapps like notion, github, basecamp etc and by comparison, my stuff just looks terrible. Has anyone here struggled with design before and what did you do about it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29909783\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "I'm building a simple crud app in Django which is basically enhanced reporting for commerce related software. So I pull information on behalf of a user from another software's API, do a bunch of aggregation/calculations on the data, and then display a report to the user.\nI'm having a hard time figuring out how to make this all happen quickly. While I'm certain there are optimizations that can be made in my Python code, I'd like to find some way to be able to make multiple calculations on reasonably large sets of objects without making the user wait like 10 seconds.\nThe problem is that the data can change in a given moment. If the user makes changes to their data in the other software, there is no way for me to know that without hitting the API again for that info. So I don't see a way that I can cache information or pre-fetch it without making a ridiculous number of requests to the API.\nIn a perfect world the API would have webhooks I could use to watch for data changes but that's not an option.\nIs my best bet to just optimize the factors I control to the best of my ability and hope my users can live with it?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29710441\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "Hello!\nIn the last few months I've worked on creating Codedraft, a mobile application that allows you to learn CSS. It is currently available on Android only:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codedraft\nThe main idea of the app is to learn and practice at your own speed, that's why the information is split into very small pieces. It offers two courses, CSS Basics and Advanced CSS, each of them being split into several sections.\nAnother feature of Codedraft is the ability to practice what you learn in the web app, available at https://app.codedraft.io. When learning in the mobile app, occasionally you have the option to scan a QR code on the web app - this action will automatically take you to a relevant coding exercise.\nThe web app can also be opened from the \"Scan Code\" tab in the mobile app.\nI've always wanted to work on an educational software, however this is my first dive into the domain. :) I would be very happy to get any type of feedback possible.\nLet me know if you have any questions and thanks a lot for reading!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29912852\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

This year, we shared our multi-platform vision for React, starting with the release of React 18 and gradual adoption of concurrent features.\nThis was the first time React Conf was hosted online, and it was streamed for free, translated to 8 different languages. Participants from all over the world joined our conference Discord and the replay event for accessibility in all timezones. Over 50,000 people registered, with over 60,000 views of 19 talks, and 5,000 participants in Discord across both events.\nAll the talks are available to stream online.\nHere’s a summary of what was shared on stage:\n\nReact 18 and concurrent fea…",

For example, I read Call of the Wild, an 80(ish) page book in 4 weeks and then I read a 400 page book in 4 days… so it's really swings and roundabouts.\nI recorded 21 books on my Kindle this year, but actually one of them was read aloud to the kids (Which I do still count) but another one was all of 19 pages… which, I think really doesn't count (it was Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory by Martha Wells). So… 20 books then.\nThis post is mostly data driven (from my own web site's data) to give me a sense of the quality of the books I've read, otherwise individual reviews are all linked in this post or available on my books page.",

          "description": "Lovely but I found the language almost too distracting.\nOnly right at the end of the book did I consider that maybe I really wasn't the right audience for the story - as it seemed to smack of \"millennium type problems\". Using air quotes in my description because I'm fairly sure this is a patronising statement I'm making!\nThe Dex character feels discontent with their achievements and is struggling to find fulfilling meaning. Their work has meaning to others but they're left feeling empty. Obviously it's an impossible measure as life trondles forward and achievements change with time.\nFor me it was only really when Dex meets the Robot (whose name I've already forgotten) when the book became more engaging. It was like the Dex character could be challenged and some real depth was offered (for better or worse for Dex's personality).\nBut what I did struggle with was the language and the odd shoehorning of gender pronouns. Dex is neither \"he\" or \"she\", so Chamber's settles with using the \"they\" pronoun. This led to my own confusion regularly thinking the lines I was reading was referring to Dex and another character that was in the scene.\nThe sore-thumb moment is when Dex asks, interestingly, what pronoun the Robot uses, and the Robot responds with \"it\" and it refers to itself as an object. Dex replies with (something like) they are the same, and their pronoun is \"they\". This seemed like a potentially interesting exchange between the Robot and Dex about the subject of how one refers to oneself and how they identify, but it doesn't happen. It just has that exchange, and then the story returns to what they were doing and carries on. It felt jarring and like Chamber's wanted to discuss this topic, but instead shoe horned it in.\nI do also suspect that my trouble with the language is a me-thing and probably with practice it won't cause me as much (or any) confusion, but for now, and this book, it definitely affected how I enjoyed the story.",

We think reading this report is the clearest way to understand what problems we are working on, how they fit into our plan for solving alignment in the worst case, and our research methodology.\nThe core difficulty we discuss is learning how to map between an AI’s model of the world and a human’s model. This is closely related to ontology identification (and other similar statements). Our main contribution is to present many possible approaches to the problem and a more precise discussion of why it seems to be difficult and important.\nThe report is available here as a google document. If you're excited about this research, we're hiring!\nQ&A\nWe're particularly excited about answering questions posted here throughout December. We welcome any questions no matter how basic or confused; we would love to help people understand what research we’re doing and how we evaluate progress in enough detail that they could start to do it themselves.\nThanks to María Gutiérrez-Rojas for the illustrations in this piece (the good ones, blame us for the ugly diagrams). Thanks to Buck Shlegeris, Jon Uesato, Carl Shulman, and especially Holden Karnofsky for helpful discussions and comments.\n\nDiscuss",

Further, vaccine efficacy has waned about 3x for most people since it’s been about six months since the vaccine wave. Some people have expressed concern about solstice in particular, which seems to turn out relatively safe. So let’s examine how you might navigate this.\nThe key takeaway is that a 1% chance of having COVID, which is about the base rate of COVID in the US, costs older relatives a few days of life if you pass it on to them.

          "description": "Making something new takes patience. But it also takes faith. Faith that everything will work out in the end.\n\nDuring the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there, but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith.\n\nThere are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they’ll work themselves out. Eventually you’ll find the right way to do something you’ve been struggling with.\n\nIt’s hard to live with something that isn’t quite right yet – especially when it’s your job to get it right. It’s important to know when to say “it’s fine for now, but it won’t be fine for later.” Because moving forward is critical to getting somewhere. And, eventually, you’ll figure it all out. It’ll all work out in the end.\n\nThis is what I’ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something’s poking out you don’t like, or something isn’t aligning quite right, or the words aren’t as elegant as you’d hoped, or something just isn’t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it’ll all come together eventually.\n\nRemember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it's never right even after.\n\nIn the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world. What fun it is!\n\n\n-Jason",

He's stressed over it, he's agonized over it, and he's spent a few too many hours thinking about all the reasons why and why not.\nThis morning he told me he was worried that it wouldn't make him happy.\nOf course it won't, I said. But that's the wrong question.\nThe better question is \"Will I enjoy it?\"\nMaking you happy is too high a bar for anything. It's unfair to ask that of anyone or anything — it's something you can really only ask yourself, or bring yourself.\nBut enjoying something? That's possible! It's very much within reach.\nSo I said, will you enjoy the car? Could you see yourself enjoying the car? Will you enjoy the drive?\nAnd that's a much easier question to answer. And an expectation that's easier to accept.\nObjects (and experiences) don't make you anything, you have to enjoy them.\nEnjoying something is plenty.\nI think he's going to buy one.",

To me, it feels similar to the rush of solving a hard problem. When the pieces suddenly fit into place, and an elegant solution emerges, you can't help but smile.\nTake nuclear power. I vividly remember the stickers from the 80s opposing it. Even looking them today, it brings warm and fuzzy memories. Together with that era's activism, like the Greenpeace Rainbow Warrior. And fundraising as a kid for the Brazilian rain forest.\nFurther more, it seemed like a settled question: The future of energy is wind and solar! Of course it is. Renewables with no downsides, right?

These indirect measures of talent have proven both unreliable and unfair. If you can, why not look directly at merit?\nWhen it comes to programmers, that merit is chiefly their ability to program! And program well. It's not the only thing that matters, and being a good programmer isn't alone sufficient to be hired at Basecamp, but it is a prerequisite. It doesn't matter what else is true about you, if your programming chops aren't up to par, there's not going to be a job offer. \nSo far, so uncontroversial, you'd think?

          "description": "The opening for director of engineering at Basecamp has barely been up for a day, and there's already an inbox full of applicants. Virtually none of whom seem to have bothered reading the basic requirements for the opening or comply with the instructions on how to make a successful application. And I'm just left thinking: What's the point? Do people think this is a lottery?\nThis isn't unique to this position, of course. We always get a large amount of applicants to openings at Basecamp who don't even seem to do the most basic work to ensure their application fits the opening. And it fascinates me, because presumably this approach must work for some people, some of the time, right? Otherwise why would you keep operating like this?\nMaybe that's part of the disillusionment with the modern job market. That applications are being processed by AI, and humans don't even see your effort, unless the computer finds the matching keywords in the CV. So why put in the effort! But is that actually true? Are lots of companies actually hiring this way? For positions like this? I'm skeptical.\nEither way, it's not how we review applications at Basecamp. There's a human on the other side, and that human is not going to spend five minutes pondering whether you might be a fit for the role, if you don't comply with the basic requirements, like including a cover letter. Or having the relevant experience required for the role (like needing experience as a \"manager of managers\" for the director of engineering).\nYou might think, what's the harm? Not like it takes a lot of effort to apply like this! Just spam the CV, and that's it. But I think there's a cost to that kind of job applications which show up in a psychological toll from a terrible applications-to-callbacks ratio. That further just worsens the feedback loop: I'm not getting callbacks, so I'll put even less effort into the next opening.\nI guess what I'm saying is make the effort or don't bother. We're not drawing names out of a hat here.",

It could be worse, you could have died!\nIt wasn't just about physical setbacks either, but the social and mental ones too. Things inside of my control, things outside of my control. The way to make those setbacks and the inevitable suffering in life bearable was to constantly remind yourself that... it could be worse!\nAny student of Stoicism will recognize this pattern of mental fortification. It's closely related to negative visualization, just with a different timing. The underlying premise is the essence of Stoicism: We suffer more in our mind than in reality. And the ultimate resilience to face the struggles of living lies in controlling our reactions to the things that happen. Our reactions are not given. They can be changed.\nI wish there was more of that today. More \"it could be worse\". Less \"this is the worst thing ever\".",

Some teams who are Basecamp curious can't seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn't tied together?\nThe simple answer is: don't. You don't need to string every todo to every commit.

There are no far-future tech demos from things in the R&D lab at Apple keynotes. While their car project is the perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in company history, they aren't deliberately trying to flaunt it. Because a tech demo isn't shipping. And shipping is what counts.\nThat's a hard ethos to live by! It's so tempting to bask in the excitement of a demo showing things that (might) come later. But it's an artificial feeling. Largely empty calories. And it often comes back to bite you in the ass when reality proves more troublesome than the imagination, and fulfilling the promises become hard or impossible.\nWe've been there plenty of times at Basecamp. Despite trying to hold the line, occasionally the temptation would prove too much, and we'd make a promise, which we occasionally couldn't keep. It sucks.\nBut the flip side is that the authentic shipping feeling is one of the best in the business. Getting real improvements, real progress, into the hands of real people. It's addicting! Yes, it's a bit of a hamster wheel, as all forms of attainment ultimately are, but there are worse things to be addicted to than shipping quality goods.\nBe a real artist. Ship.",

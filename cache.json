It starts with our new homepage  where we have a more complete representation of Bootstrap’s features and an updated design.\n\n\nThe docs sidebar navigation has been overhauled to have always expanded groups for easier browsing, a brand new DocSearch experience with search history, and new responsive offcanvas drawers for both sidebar and navbar on mobile.\n\n\n\n\nWe even updated our version picker in the navbar to cross-link between minor releases!\n\n\nUpdated buttons and inputs…",

          "description": "After several months, we’ve finally shipped Bootstrap v4.6.2, one of our last releases for the v4. It’s a bit of a maintenance patch featuring bug fixes, dependency updates, and some docs updates.\nRead on for the highlights or head to the v4.6.x docs to see the latest in action.\nWhat’s changed\nThere are two big highlights in v4.6.2:\nFirst, we’ve added an example to our Collapse plugin docs to show how to use horizontal collapsing. This has long been possible via our JS, but we never had an official class to utilize it.\nSecond, we’ve replaced the deprecated color-adjust with print-color-adjust in our Sass files as part of the Autoprefixer v10.4.6 issues. This should quiet the issues folks have seen from that dependency change. If you’re using our distribution CSS files, like bootstrap.min.css, you may still see the warning.\nBeyond that, we’ve addressed a few other things:\nTweaked the size of small and .small to compute to a whole pixel value (was 12.8px and now is 14px).\nImproved accessibility around our dropdowns, color contrast, and role attributes.\nFixed some broken links to supporting documentation.\nUpdated dependencies across the board.\nReview the GitHub v4.6.2 release changelog for more details.\nFrom here, we don’t expect to ship any meaningful updates to v4.6.x other than major security or dependency updates. Everything will focus on v5 and beyond after this release, starting with the stable release of v5.2.0. Bootstrap 4 will officially end of life January 1, 2023, though you’re obviously welcome to continue using it longer than that. Follow our release repo to stay in the loop on release maintenance status.\nSupport the team\nVisit our Open Collective page or our team members’ GitHub profiles to help support the maintainers contributing to Bootstrap.",

          "description": "Dave Rupert recently published a post expressing his frustration with the urgent case for action on climate change, and lack of co-ordinated policy action by the people in power. While much of the world suffers from extreme high temperures this summer, climate change has become a visible, tangible issue for many of us.\nDave rightly points out that the environmental responsibility has been unfairly hoisted onto the consumer, when in reality this is by the design of governments and large corporations, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Individual lifestyle changes, such as reusable shopping bags, sorting our recycling, or going vegan are never going to make much of a difference when faced with the unstoppable juggernaut of capitalism.\nI agree that widespread societal ch…",

          "description": "Something I like about logical properties is the ability to set margins or padding on just a single axis on an element, while leaving the other alone. Say we have an element on which we’ve set some padding using the padding shorthand:\n/* This gives us 1rem padding all the way around */\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\nIf, later on, we want to adjust the padding only on the x-axis (while preserving our original value on the y-axis), we have a couple of choices:\nWe could use padding-left and padding-right. Fine, but longer than our original shorthand.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-right: 2rem;\n  padding-left: 2rem;\n}\nWe could use the shorthand, but remembering to include our original values.\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding: 1rem 2rem;\n}\nI’m not a huge fan of having to repeat the original value for the y-axis padding. We could abstract those values out into custom properties — something like this:\n.box {\n  padding: var(--py, 1rem) var(--px, 1rem);\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  --px: 2rem;\n}\nOn the other hand, there is a logical property that enables us to adjust the padding on a single axis: padding-inline refers to the padding on the x-axis when the document is in the left-to-right (default) or right-to-left writing mode. padding-block refers to the y-axis. (Those directions are reversed for a vertical writing mode.)\nSo instead we could write:\n.box {\n  padding: 1rem;\n}\n.box--some-variant {\n  padding-inline: 2rem;\n}\nCodepen demo →\nThe same applies to margins, borders and a bunch of others. And check out the inset property for a great positioning shorthand!\nLogical properties are very well supported in browsers now, so it’s a good time to start using them.",

          "description": "I spoke about CSS layout at CSS Day conference recently, and in the Q&A session afterwards I was asked about masonry layout in CSS. Masonry layout, in case you’re not aware, is where different height items are laid out in columns but, rather than being aligned on the row axis, the items below effectively move up to plug any gaps, kind of like a bricklayer — hence the name. Pinterest’s grid design is a commonly-cited example whenever the masonry conversation comes up.\nThe current state of masonry in CSS\nCurrently we can build a kind of faux-masonry (or “fakesonry”, if you will) layout in CSS by using columns.\n.list {\n  columns: 20rem;\n  column-gap: 1rem;\n}\nSee the Pen \n  Masonry grid (Firefox with flag enabled) by Michelle Barker (@michellebarker)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\nThis will create a layout t…",

It’s a major minor problem that’s tough to explain to the client, but it all comes down to…\nThe dangler.\nOdd number grids are a sore point in Responsive Design. Even numbered grids collapse easily from 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column, but odd numbered grids leave you with one extra column to figure out. You have two choices: drop the odd column to its own row or take the coward’s route and convert 3 columns → 1 column prematurely at ~800px. If you take that r…",

More worryingly, it’s another summer in what looks like a trend of increasingly hot summers due to unstoppable climate change. It’s hot enough that the grass is dying in places that don’t have shade. The heat is so exhausting we’re making trips to cooler states in the summer to escape, ironically those trips are on planes, which exacerbates the climate problem.\nI’m desperate to figure out a way I can help. I keep researching what ascetic life changes I could make to have the biggest impact. I could go vegan tomorrow if it made a big difference… but… and I hate to be a cynic… but one dude in Texas changing his diet isn’t going to save the Earth.

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.\nI did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I'm trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.\nWhat could I have done differently?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32022275\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

          "description": "I'm looking for resources/tips on how to learn concepts in system design. Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I'd also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.\nIn terms of what I've done so far...\nI've read\n- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.\n- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It's been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.\n- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I've really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.\nI'd really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.\nThank you very much!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32014658\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.\nIt also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it's easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don't want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.\nI miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.\nIn my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.\nIt makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it's UI/UX hasn't changed (In major ways) for many years?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31991675\nPoints: 60\n# Comments: 87",

          "description": "Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don't pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.\nFor me, I've used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.\nMy least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn't do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It's a confusing mess and there's just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.\nThere's plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter's design in general over other apps.\nWhat about you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31971019\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I wanted to know what documentation tools are people using to write software design docs. I have mostly seen that people use whichever general purpose Docs application is being used in their organization to write software docs too (Google Docs, Notion, etc).\nIf there was to exist a documentation software especially for software design documents, what features would be the most important? Are there any tools which do this well?\nAlso, as a software engineer, have you ever felt that the documentation software you use is lacking and does not help you communicate your ideas well, due to lack of native support for content like diagrams, schemas, state machines, etc.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31947406\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:\n- An extremely productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn't even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.\n- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.\n- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set `contenteditable=\"true\"` on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.\n- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things \"foo\" when he can't think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called \"foo\" until we came up with a name.\nWhat are some good examples you've witnessed?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31905280\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "Hello HN, my name is Chris. My team and I are excited to announce the launch of our new open source UI component library called Skeleton.\nWe've been hard at work for several months and am thrilled to finally pull back the curtain. The goal is to put it out there, let folks go hands on, and gather any feedback we can. If there's bug, a component you would like to see added etc., then we want to know so we can continue to grow and make this better for everyone.\nBeing open source, we welcome any contributions from the community. If you're interested in joining, you can find us on Github:\nhttps://github.com/Brain-Bones/skeleton\nAnd yes, we realize that the combination of Svelte and Tailwind may place us in a niche. Personally speaking, we've had a lot of success with these technologies in the real world. We love what Rich Harris and his team are bringing to the frontend space with Svelte and SvelteKit, and have found Tailwind to be a great boon when creating design systems for web-based apps We're really hoping Skeleton can bridge the gap and provide the best of both worlds, while saving you the time of recreating these components yourself.\nThat's really the biggest benefit of Skeleton - the tight integration between Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It utilizes Tailwind’s utility classes to customize and extend the look and feel of each component. Then pairs this with Svelte’s awesome component architecture. This allows you to create customized, responsive, and reactive interfaces with surprisingly minimal effort.\nOf course, feel free to try it out for yourself. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to see what everyone can produce with Skeleton!\nThanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32242781\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

I know this is rather small and incomplete compared to other projects but I've thought you folk might be interested.\nNot sure if it breaks the pure part, but the site also uses Flask.\nIf you're lucky, you might find the app alive at: https://formie.div72.xyz.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32193896\nPoints: 16\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "Hey there, I am Honey - Co-founder at Locofy.\nWe, along with other makers, have been building Locofy.ai to help massively accelerate the builders - the designers, developers, product managers & founders, and we're excited to share it today with the HN Community.\nLocofy.ai simply converts designs into production-ready frontend code for web and mobile apps. It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.\nWith this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.\nToday, we have also launched on Product Hunt. Let us know your thoughts and suggestions: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/locofy-ai.\nOur team will be answering all your questions!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32135638\nPoints: 6\n# Comments: 2",

In each case, elements specific to the logged-in-user and the related images get fetched via api calls and are rendered client side.\nFor rendering the rest of the page -\n1. Everything is rendered client side - one can use a single page application to handle the routing.

So nice that I decided to rip it and modified it to become a classless CSS style.\nI spend about a few hours modding the CSS, removing/replacing class-based part, fixing bugs, and add additional features, such as custom blockquotes.\nThe style will needs some more work, but basically it has done what it needs to do.\nI would love hearing your feedbacks and comments on the project!\n[0]: https://subreply.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31920615\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

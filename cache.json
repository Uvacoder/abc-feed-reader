          "description": "For the past two years, all of Clearleft’s events have been online. Like everyone else running conferences, we had to pivot in the face of The Situation.\nIn hindsight, it’s remarkable how well those online events went. This was new territory for everyone—speakers, attendees, and organisers.\nUX Fest was a real highlight. I had the pleasure of hosting the event, giving it my Woganesque best. It was hard work, but it paid off.\nStill, it’s not quite the same as gathering together with your peers in one place for a shared collective experience. I’ve really been missing in-person events (and from what I’ve seen in people’s end-of-year blog posts, I’m not alone).\nThat’s why I’m absolutely thrilled that UX London is back in 2022!

Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays.

It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine.

When I said that I included screenshots on that page, I may have underplayed the effort involved. It was real faff.\nI’ve got an iPhone so generating screenshots (and video) from that wasn’t too bad. But I don’t have access to an Android phone. I found myself scouring the web for templates that I could use to mockup a screenshot of the address bar.\nThat got me thinking…\nWouldn’t it be cool if there were a service that generated those screenshots for you? You give it a URL, and it spits out screenshots of the site complete with overlays showing the installation flow on Android and iOS. It could even generate the img markup, complete with differently-scaled images for the srcset attribute.\nDownload the images. Copy that markup. Paste it into a page on your site. Boom! Now you’ve got somewhere to point your visitors to if you’d like them to install your progressive web app.\nThere are already some services out there for generating screenshots of mobile phones but they’re missing is the menu overlays for adding to home screen.\nThe devrels at both Google and Microsoft have been doing a great job of promoting progressive web apps. They’ve built tools to help you with tasks like generating icons or creating your web app manifest. It would be sooooo nifty if those tools also generated instructional screenshots for adding to home screen!",

That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before.

The different selectors you can use  determine the specificity of any style rule. For example, elements are less specific than classes or attributes, which are in turn less specific than IDs.

          "description": "We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.\nShe did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it's just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I'm 100% biased): https://kevin.tw\nFun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn't have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30344989\nPoints: 788\n# Comments: 158",

Ideally, I can outsource most of this to a good web dev agency. We are in the MLOps space, and so some domain knowledge from the agency would be great (or the ablity to learn about the space and incorporate it into the design).

To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main \"erpnext\" account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!\nI am a pretty proficient user and I wasn't drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.\nMy feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than \"Feedback\". To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.\nIf any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30164146\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

The app is simple, with following features: account creation, creation of \"content\"(e.g. a blog post), commenting, reporting, up/down voting, bookmarking and tagging. So during the development I thought what if I treat everything in the app as \"content\" and create hierarchy of the content, and then create every entity relation in the DB as many-to-many. Naturally, lot of tables were created in the DB. But that got me thinking, that this design opens up lots of interesting use-cases such as sub-accounts, group accounts, sub-posts, multi-commenting, multi-reporting, comment-threading, group-posting etc.\nThis was a very interesting exercise. I think there will be DB performance as well as storage size issues with this design. Not sure though, never tried anything like this in practice.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30033277\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

In each, I keep observing a pattern - people seem uninterested in writing System Design / Architecture documentation.\nI struggle to grok a system if I can’t read about the context. What are the goals/antigoals? What constraints was the system built under? What big architectural choices were evaluated? (e.g Serverless vs Containers)\nDigging deeper I also see a lack of consideration for non-functional attributes like Performance, Capacity and High Availability.\nCloud paradigms can help to an extent with auto-scaling etc., but I feel there should still be a model for the expected Perf/Capacity, given the selected SW+HW stack.\nIn the case of High Availability, I continully see teams running critical Prod services without clearly documenting the expected behaviour if an Instance, AZ/Datacentre, Region or  an external dependency goes down.\nAll of these observations have been in highly regulated industries with significant tech budgets.\nSo HN:\nDo you teams document these architectural designs?\nHave I perhaps lost touch with modern practices?\nHow do you grow teams (or defend the design from Mgmt / Auditors) if this information is held in peoples heads?\nAppreciate your input and apologies as English is my second language.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30003513\nPoints: 35\n# Comments: 25",

          "description": "Hi all, author here.\nThis project was a pleasure to do, Remix has very good developer experience. But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).\nAnd it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!\nYou can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.\nBy the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30373847\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "Geniunly curious and not competent to answer this myself.\nI am a hobbyist. I don't intend to take a career in front-end (maybe in a decade) and just hacking away on my own small projects using external APIs. It is probably for another post but after being scared of coding for such a long time, it seems so interesting and kind of a new world (despite the frustrations obviously).\nThe thing is, I came quite late to it and learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JS whilst finally delving into React which has been... welll confusing. It generally feels like an overkill and learning new things about it not enjoyable anymore as a beginner.\nI have delved into Svelte in the past week and it just has been a completely different story. I am not associated with them, and I am not trying to promote it as I want to just ask whether React felt as frustrating as for me or am I missing something?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30046364\nPoints: 24\n# Comments: 45",

There, I said it.\nI've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.\nI understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.\nI've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.\nInstead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.\nOk, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?\nI must be missing something, right?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355757\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 20",

          "description": "I have a well established phone checking habit.\nIf I'm developing and my tests are running I pick up my phone. If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what's happening on it. If I'm working on a problem and I'm not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).\nI don't like the habit, but I have it.\nI used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.\nThere are two directions I can go in (I think):\n1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)\n2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).\nDoes anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?\nDoes anyone have any success getting more comfortable \"holding\" the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik's cube?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30245071\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "Hi there HN.\nAamu.app is an app that I've made and I hope to get some feedback.\nIt aims to have all the most important productivity tools (for companies) in one package. It will hopefully get more of those features in time, but currently there are already quite a few – tasks, docs, video meetings and so on.\nWhy did I do it? Because I thought the current ones were not that good, and I'm talking about things like Microsoft's offering now. The different parts of their software were clumsy and they were not integrated very well into the whole – i.e. different parts were not designed in collaboration in mind.\nI realize it's quite a big app for one person to do, but let's just say that I felt I needed to do and finish it. Couldn't stop after I had started it.\n---\nHere's an url you can try it without registering into it, and the usernames/passwords:\nhttps://piper.aamu.app/\nusername: richard ... password: richard1\nusername: gilfoyle ... password: gilfoyle\nusername: bighead ... password: nbighead\nusername: dinesh ... password: xxdinesh\n---\nThe main url of the site: https://aamu.app/\nHope to get some feedback, thanks!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30019284\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 3",

I was wrong, but I definitely enjoyed the challenge!\n\nOpening up the Gameboy up and took a peek, and yep, found game pak loading doberry had been messed with. Bit of a duff job on whoever tried to repair it before me - and it even looks like they spotted there was a short and tried to slice through it with a knife:\n\nPins A2 and A1 were definitely connected! Some flux and solder later and it looks more like this:\n\nAnd now the Gameboy boots with a nice clean Nintendo logo.

I'm now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.\nAnd personally speaking, I'm just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.\nI'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.\nAnd I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.\nStay tuned.",

          "description": "I'd been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since retiring from the back-and-forth, it's clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.\nThis is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I'd be surprised if you aren't aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it's a shock to the system.\nThat shock isn't the problem, though. It's the solution. It's your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, producing everything from ulcers to heart disease.\nI think most people already know this, but I don't think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn't be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries. That's a longitudinal study I'd love to see.

          "description": "Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It's quite literally a creative force.\nWhen you're focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.\nThis is the wisdom of the Mark Twain's etiquette \"never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company\". Specifically the point about \"polite company\". It's the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.\nAll this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People's religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. \nToday social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people's stances on the thorniest issues. It's often hard not to know someone's leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.\nBut it's worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That's the choice of the creative force.",

That Rogan is a menace to society because he host guests with divergent views on covid, and because he shares his unsanctioned opinion on the matter. Therefore, the only reason they're not yanking him is fear. Fear of losing subscribers, money, marketshare, whatever. It can't possibly be due to a genuine disagreement with the menace-to-society charge.\nJonathan Haidt talks about this in The Righteous Mind:\n\nMorality binds and blinds.

No mask mandates, no vaccine passports, no distancing, no limitations on bars, restaurants, or night clubs. This follows a determination by the government's pandemic council that the virus is no longer threat to the functioning of society, and thus no longer warrants broad, societal restrictions.\nWhat's striking about this decision is that it's been taken against a backdrop of all-time record infection rates. In Copenhagen, the incident rate per 100,000 was 4,735 over the past seven days! The national positivity rate on the almost quarter of a million PCR tests performed every day is now 23%!

          "description": "The Dutch competition authorities just slapped Apple with a five million euro fine for refusing to comply with the country's new requirements on App Store policies. These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business [crimes]!\nThe five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball points out, €50 million is \"spare-change-under-the-sofa\" money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue.\nThis is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there's a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law.\nI don't necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don't apply when you're dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a €50 million fine is chump change.\nWhat'll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there's just no way this is the last stop. If Apple willfully decides to flip off the Dutch and their national sovereignty, I think we might just see the leviathan that is the European Union awaken.",

But now the party is over, and what used to be free will now easily cost $500/year or more (if you have 10 users on a custom domain). Yikes.\nUnsurprisingly, I'm not actually against Google charging for email. The long deep freeze of innovation in email came as a result of Google giving away free* service. (* It wasn't ever free FREE, of course, but the price in data and attention wasn't obvious to most before they got hooked.)\nThe problem is the switcheroo. When you give something away for free for years, and then suddenly show up with a demand for payment, people are rightfully going to feel like it's a stickup. Especially if they have over a decade's worth of data that's difficult to get out locked inside that box you gave them for \"free\".\nIt feels even more so if the vendor showing up with demands for payment is a monopolist like Google. Who controls the majority of all email that flows in the US. Then it very much feels like you got suckered. Oh, we were just the stepping stone for you to get the dominant marketshare, and now that you've captured it, you return for the loot? Gah.\nEmail wasn't ever free to offer. Especially not the unlimited kind with gigabytes of storage that gave Gmail its original splash. It's just that Google monetized it through data plunder (like reading your purchase receipts!), attention drains (promoted emails!), and now finally with a paid switcheroo for the most locked-in accounts.\nYou could of course also just pay with cash monies from the get go. And vote with those dollars for what you'd like to see more of in the world. How's that for a New Year's resolution: Paying for things with money, and skipping the ones that aren't worth it.",

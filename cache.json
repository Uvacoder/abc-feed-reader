New data tables needed to be created for the application too. The person that designed the application is not technical at all. They only designed the front-end and I designed the data model based off it.\nI did the best I could with the information I had and we are slowly starting to see a working prototype, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that I'm trying to figure out. The project is behind. I want to take responsibility for it being behind. But at the same time the project seems understaffed and it appears too much is being asked considering the size of the team.\nWhat could I have done differently?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32022275\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 2",

Things around backend engineering and all the various components that go into building large scale systems (load balancing, message queues, CDNs, etc.). I'd also like to learn concepts around data like database sharding, non-relational database models, streaming/batch (lambda architecture, kappa architecture, etc.) and more.\nIn terms of what I've done so far...\nI've read\n- Designing Data Intensive Applications (https://dataintensive.net/) - This book has been recommended a ton on HN/twitter/reddit and I found it extremely useful to get a better idea of how data systems work, different types (OLAP vs. OLTP, data warehouse vs. lake, etc.) and get a better understanding of distributed systems.\n- Quastor (https://www.quastor.org/) - This is a newsletter that sends out summaries of system design blog posts from Big Tech engineering blogs. It's been helpful to me for getting an understanding of the different components involved in the tech stacks at various companies and how companies think about building scalable systems.\n- MIT Distributed Systems (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-W...) - This is a series of lectures by Robert Morris (co-founder of YC) on distributed systems and their properties. The lectures pick a specific tool/technology (Google File System, ZooKeeper, Apache Spark, etc.) and then discusses it. I've really enjoyed reading the papers and watching the lectures.\nI'd really love any recommendations from the HN community on how else I should be learning about system design.\nThank you very much!\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32014658\nPoints: 86\n# Comments: 13",

          "description": "I find myself lately gravitating back to older communities that survived the social media wave on the Internet because they seem to be a bit better at keeping track and promoting visibility of meaningful conversations, despite traditional functional flaws, screen sizing, and often dreadful large threaded views. I think a major strength is that most of these traditionally designed sites/apps still emphasize chronological order for content and posts, which makes the experience less prone to manipulation and more timely.\nIt also seems with older sites like HN and online bulletin boards, content can be bookmarked, and it's easier to correspond with users on a more regular basis. I think the most frustrating trend on modern sites and apps is that content I want to see simply disappears into a sea of other things I don't want to see, and that searching to find that content is futile, as results are often gamified and spammed into oblivion.\nI miss IRC now, I miss bulletin boards despite all the flaws, I miss old school web sites that had the same content in the same place even after hitting refresh.\nIn my opinion, traditionally highly effective, favorable, and functional user-experience-based design has been thrown out the window lately as a trend; apps now are very often geared towards tracking, sponsored post placement, and profit/revenue optimization goals, rather than towards creating favorable user experiences.\nIt makes me wonder (despite some issues of course) if HN is still one of the best places to communicate and post serious matters BECAUSE it's UI/UX hasn't changed (In major ways) for many years?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31991675\nPoints: 60\n# Comments: 87",

          "description": "Which social media app do you think has the best design? This can include UX or UI design. Apparently most people don't pay attention to fonts, symbols and other stuff closely, but for those of us that do, which app speaks to you the most? This can really be any app, but preferably one of the more known social media apps.\nFor me, I've used Twitter probably the most by far, so I might be biased. They have a great black dark mode. The font is genuinely so cool. The high contrast labels and icons are so pleasing to look at.  The profile pages are cool and overall, the app layout makes the most sense to me in terms of the replies and features. Apparently Twitter is one of the more confusing apps to use, but Reddit is insanely confusing to me. When you look at social media and the internet overall, Twitter and Bootstrap seem to have had the biggest influence on app and website design, so many apps have similar features that Twitter does.\nMy least favorite is probably Reddit and Snapchat. Snapchat is pretty smooth to use, but the colors and bubble-like design just doesn't do it for me, and the profiles and searching thing is very confusing. Reddit is just a horrifically slow app and replies to posts are insanely annoying to sift through. I find myself closing every first tier replies so I can read replies instead if replies to replies. It's a confusing mess and there's just about nothing on the app that makes sense to me, which is interesting considering Quora, Twitter and Reddit are essentially the same thing and apparently had some of the same people on their design teams.\nThere's plenty of more stuff I like about Twitter, but the main thing is that fact that I prefer Twitter's design in general over other apps.\nWhat about you?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31971019\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "I self taught back end, and can now make full apps with ruby on rails. Unsurprisingly, my finished applications never look quite right. I use bootstrap which helps a lot.\nI think the problem is mostly with the layout of elements on the page. I try not to overdo things with unnecessary elements, and am at a point where each individual piece of the webpage (e.g. a button, a logo, a navbar, a form) looks fine on its own, but doesn't look professional as a whole (for reasons I'm not yet perceptive enough to detect - I can tell it's clunky but I can't articulate why).\nI know 30 minutes is ambitious, but I'm working on an MVP and don't have a lot of time right now (in the future, absolutely).\nAny recommendations for crash courses, videos, articles, or tutorials greatly appreciated! Particularly interested to hear from anyone who wasn't a design 'natural', and had to self teach as I am.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31889958\nPoints: 38\n# Comments: 15",

          "description": "For the past 2 months I've been struggling to hire a web designer to create a website for me. I wrote the entire product specification, all screens and app flows, and I want a designer to take that spec and turn it into a real product design.\nAttempt #1: Direct hire\nPosted a local job and hired a person based on their portfolio. We signed the contract, and they started the project. 2 weeks later I check in and all they have done is the color palette and fonts. I don't think I'm unreasonable when I say this is way too little work for 2 weeks booked at 8 hours / day. I closed the contract afterwards and I consider I simply got scammed. Am I being unreasonable here?\nAttempt #2: Upwork\nI posted my project on Upwork for a fixed price, estimated at 300 hours and with a price per hour that matches what Upwork says is their \"top freelancers\". I received more than 100 applications in the first 3 hours. Looking at their past work and portfolio, I notice a lot of them have linked the same projects, with the same screenshots and project description. I closed the project after I saw that, fearing another scam.\nAttempt #3: LinkedIn\nPosted a job for a contract-based short term project. I received less than 20 applicants in a week, and most of them sent me 5 page CVs without a portfolio. The portfolios that I got from the rest of them were very slim, presenting 1-2 project mockups which could barely be called projects, even though they called themselves experienced professionals.\nI'm currently out of ideas on what to try next. I'm willing to pay top money for top work, and I mentioned this in every job ad, but for some reason all I get is scam attempts or homework projects.\nDo you have some advice on how to hire high quality designers? Is there something wrong that I'm doing here?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31827449\nPoints: 5\n# Comments: 9",

Adobe XD to proper Html/CSS\nbut I've not found any.\nSo I tried using just UI frameworks like Bootstrap, however, but learning curve was bigger and every page looked the same. (And don't suggest tailwind)\nMaybe there is outsourced service to whom I can give designs and get html/css back for very low cost like $10-20 per page.

          "description": "I really enjoy it when I see programmers with a deranged disregard for aesthetics in the name of efficiency or productivity. Some of my favorited examples from my own experience:\n- An extremely productive, like, 100x senior engineer I know works on a stock Ubuntu box with the default desktop wallpaper and an un-customized IntelliJ IDE and when he opens an IDE window he doesn't even full screen or center it. Just blasting code in an un-centered 68% width IDE.\n- The smartest person I know (like, easily) uses the tcsh shell, the nvi editor, and the twm or ratpoision window manager, all ancient, unmaintained tools. I think they were the state of the art when he started using Unix and he never bothered switching.\n- I saw a very clever bitcoin developer just set `contenteditable=\"true\"` on an HTML element and use it as a text editor, I think because he already had the window open.\n- Another developer I know with insane quality standards just names things \"foo\" when he can't think of a name for things, to the point where we worked on a project together for a month in a repo called \"foo\" until we came up with a name.\nWhat are some good examples you've witnessed?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31905280\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "Hey HN!\nRecently I came across SubReply[0], a social media site, and its CSS style is really nice. So nice that I decided to rip it and modified it to become a classless CSS style.\nI spend about a few hours modding the CSS, removing/replacing class-based part, fixing bugs, and add additional features, such as custom blockquotes.\nThe style will needs some more work, but basically it has done what it needs to do.\nI would love hearing your feedbacks and comments on the project!\n[0]: https://subreply.com\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31920615\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 1",

          "description": "Hi HN! Philip and Stephen here, we are the co-founders of FireJet (https://www.firejet.io), which allows you to export from Figma to Tailwind CSS.\nWe first met at university, where we did several project together, often first designing in Figma and then developing the Frontend manually. It’s not that it was extremely hard to code out our app Frontends - however, it felt pretty dumb to be doing twice the amount of work, once while designing and then once again to implement the design in code.\nWe tried several other tools which were similar to FireJet, but the main problem we always ran into was that the other tools had alot of features like automatic semantic tagging, implementing Material UI components, and so on, but none of them got the one fundamental thing we needed it to do - which was convert it to code. Some competitors were converting certain figma frames into images, which as you can imagine is about as useful as replacing your website with an  tag\nWe made a quick prototype in a week, and people who needed the specific tailwind functionality loved it. Fast forward about 3 months, we have 700 downloads and a small (but growing!) group of dedicated users who keep coming back to us and helping us improve the product.\nEven now, our landing page and our plugin UI are themselves developed using FireJet itself, and because we ourselves are a startup we are not too worried about coding best practices, but rather iterating and developing as fast as possible, which is why FireJet is useful for us.\nSo we are launching FireJet here in the spirit of building in public, and we hope that FireJet reduce your time to market for your startup / agency / company!\nYou can see a portfolio website I made using FireJet here:\nSample Website: https://philipwee.github.io/\nGithub Repository: https://github.com/PhilipWee/philipwee.github.io\nFigma File: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119632484827501100\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31779160\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 0",

I suspect that I am being targeted for an elaborate phishing attack. No one will be jacking my clicks, I can assure you of that.\nIf not a nation-state level cyber-attack: might this be yet another instance of a Richard Revolution video trolling?\nOr perhaps you’ve simply let your domain name renewal lapse. Has the technology behind domain parking pages advanced to a never before seen level of individualized personalization? Is this a marketing ploy by GoDaddy on this the most sacred of company holidays: GoFather’s Day?\nPlease contact me through the usual second-factor back-channels to ensure that everything is—as GitHub status tweets casually and confidently repeat—operating normally.\nUntil then I’m afraid the link will remain unapologetically and skeptically :not(:visited).\nKind domain shards,\nZach",

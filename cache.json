It’s great to see browsers working to support new CSS features quicker than ever before, and that pace should persist with Interop, an initiative where browser vendors work together to implement features interoperably. And with so-called “evergreen” browsers, most users should see those new features right away, as their browsers update seamlessly.\nBut, as Jim Neilsen pointed out, that doesn’t mean every user has the latest and greatest browser version. Many older devices can’t update to the latest version. The OS doesn’t support it. This means that:\nYou need to test your website on older devices, and\nIf you’re…",

One of the cool things about the selector is that it allows us to not only style a parent element based on any one of its children, but to also style that child’s siblings too. So, building a menu, we could apply some styles to other elements in the menu when one of the links is hovered:\n/* Style the list border when link is hovered */\nul:has(a:hov…",

          "description": "I got some landscaping done this month and as a reward the YouTube algorithm brought me a new genre of video called “Tall Grass”. These are the lawns with shoulder high grass, filled with mice and snakes, endlessly consuming buildings, fences, and concrete. It’s complete and utter ASMR for me.\n\nMy favorite among them is Al Bladez. Al and his best friend AJ take one day a week and offer to mow someone-in-need’s yard for free. To be clear, there’s an economy here, the homeowner gets their yard mowed and Al gets a YouTube video out of the deal which garners a million views. But the homeowners — and more often than not, the neighbors — are incredibly thankful to see the transformations.\nThe circumstances differ from yard to yard. Sometimes the homeowner is elderly, ailing, deceased, or in the hospital; unable or unfit to mow their lawn. In those situations Al’s work is a simple act of charity.\nSometimes, the homeowner is perfectly able but hasn’t mowed their lawn. What I love about Al is that he doesn’t show an ounce of judgement. Al doesn’t care if you’ve been in jail, or if you’re too poor, your mower broke, you’re unemployed, you’re struggling with addiction, or you’re just plain lazy. He’s there to cut grass — tall grass — and bring a bit of pride back to his community and hopefully help people dodge citations from the city.\nTo top it off, Al’s personal slogan is “Impact Over Views” and whew, that’s a lot to think about. I love that outlook and wish I could embody it more.\nWhatever religion Al is peddling, I want to be a part of it.",

This weekend I started on my planned redesign, but as I started nudging my About section, I found myself in a fight with my typography. After some hemming and hawing, I made the drastic decision to nuke my stylesheets and start over.\n~81 file changes later, I made another decision to yeet my changes live and do an open redesign. Not my original plan, but it’ll be good blog fodder. One thing I want to avoid is killing blogging momentum by getting sunk in a redesign branch.\nWithout further ado, as with any redesign, let’s see what we’re dealing with first…\nWebsite feature inventory\nHere’s a list of all the features on my little website that I maintain:\n330+ blog posts\nArt-directed posts with custom CSS, JavaScript, and SV…",

PARA is a way to organize your digital life in to separate buckets: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.\n\nAfter watching some videos, I started applying PARA to my second brain in Notion. The timing to choose to redo my entire Notion setup was horrible, of course. I was busy with work, writing a workshop, moving ShopTalk to its own YouTube channel… why not pick up another big project and redo my entire organization system?\nThe psychology checks out though. When large tasks loom you don’t feel in control over your schedule and doing something you can control (like organizing your organizer) helps you feel more in control. And it did help.

Coworkers are often too busy to keep track of what’s going on with engineering work, even if it’s their job to know what’s going on with engineering work. It’s generally not out of malice or lack of interest, but a lack of time and energy to chase down every issue or conversation thread. And to be fair, engineering is an opaque process where we trick the rocks inside a computer to act like a business.\nStandups are a great tool for sharing visibility. Unfortunately, not everyone loves standups. I’ve personally experienced some extremely toxic scrum master situations. Impersonal bots can have the same effect.

Apple products are my personal devices and habe a windows laptop from the company i work for.\nI saw obviously material design on my sites. But for the first time a task given me to remove Bootstrat from a project and use Vuetify (Matrial Design flavored) instead.\nMy experience is more than awful. Who think that the bounce effect on click can be a good thing? Why button texts have to be uppercase? Is the border at bottom really means something?\nI can’t really engage with this design system and i can’t really understand why is this thing so popular.

          "description": "I sometimes spot colleagues making design decisions that seem really bad to me. A common pattern is building something that already exists in much better form as open source software. I usually try to get them to realize the error themselves by asking questions like \"how does this compare to open source library X\" but it doesn't always work. How do you deal with things like this, keeping in mind that I'm not all knowing and could be wrong but also feel a responsibility to protect the larger organization from bad tech.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30955731\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 2",

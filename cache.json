          "description": "The first speakers are live on the UX London 2022 site! There are only five people announced for now—just enough to give you a flavour of what to expect. There will be many, many more.\nPutting together the line-up of a three-day event is quite challenging, but kind of fun too. On the one hand, each day should be able to stand alone. After all, there are one-day tickets available. On the other hand, it should feel like one cohesive conference, not three separate events.\nI’ve decided to structure the three days to somewhat mimic the design process…\nThe first day is all about planning and preparation. This is like the first diamond in the double-diamond process: building the right thing. That means plenty of emphasis on research.\nThe second day is about creation and execution. It’s like that …",

If I win, that money goes to the Bletchley Park Trust. If Matt wins, it goes to The Internet Archive.\nI’m very happy to lose this bet.\nWhen I made the original prediction eleven years ago that a URL on the longbets.org site would no longer be available, I did so in a spirit of mischief—it was a deliberately meta move. But it was also informed by a genuine feeling of pessimism around the longevity of links on the web.

Like everyone else running conferences, we had to pivot in the face of The Situation.\nIn hindsight, it’s remarkable how well those online events went. This was new territory for everyone—speakers, attendees, and organisers.\nUX Fest was a real highlight. I had the pleasure of hosting the event, giving it my Woganesque best. It was hard work, but it paid off.\nStill, it’s not quite the same as gathering together with your peers in one place for a shared collective experience. I’ve really been missing in-person events (and from what I’ve seen in people’s end-of-year blog posts, I’m not alone).\nThat’s why I’m absolutely thrilled that UX London is back in 2022!

Besides, some of us don’t work on Fridays. So Thursday really is the new Friday.\nAt this Thursday afternoon meeting we give and get updates on what’s been happening with project work, new business, events, marketing. We also highlighted any shout-outs that have posted in the #beingsplendid Slack channel during the week.

It’s well worth reading, especially the section on competition in the supply of mobile browsers:\nOn iOS devices, Apple bans the use of alternative browser engines – this means that Apple has a monopoly over the supply of browser engines on iOS. It also chooses not to implement – or substantially delays – a wide range of features in its browser engine.

An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).\nOften we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)\nOne thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.\nTools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.\nVisit the site →",

In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:\nThe very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.\nThat’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory. Sometimes the act of writing itself is enough to preserve it in my mind.\nI’d like to get…",

          "description": "Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.\nWeb Performance And The Planet\nFershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.\nWatch Fershad’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nBuilding a Greener Web\nMy own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.\nWatch the talk →\nSee the slides →\nThe Carbon Footprint of Images\nJon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.\nWatch Jon’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nYou might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!",

That’s certainly not a complaint from me: it makes sense to consider properties as part of an ecosystem. But I have to confess, I love it when a new CSS property lands in browsers that doesn’t have a steep learning curve and just works, with no fuss. The aspect-ratio property hits all the right spots there, neatly solving with a single line of CSS something that was, quite frankly, a bit of faff before. It’s been supported in browsers for going on a year now, but with Safari finally catching up in September 2021, we can finally …",

It’s known for being super fast.\nElectron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty.

I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process.

It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.\nWith the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.\n\nふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n\nThe city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world",

          "description": "“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”\nManos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.\nI first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.\n\n\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n\n\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'",

          "description": "Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!\nThe biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now\nlicensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI\napproved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,\ncommercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.\nI've also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -\nhttps://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,\ntabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a\nsimple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There\nare also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code\nhighlighting.\nHibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on\nJS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,\nreuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.\nNo tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,\nno build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.\nIt works works great for embedding into backend\nservers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or\nadding dynamic functionality to static sites.\nI'd love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.\nIf you have a project you'd like to use Hibiki HTML on, I'm also happy\nto lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you\nmight need.\n* Interactive Tutorial - https://playground.hibikihtml.com/tutorial/\n* Bulma UI Controls - https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html\n* Github - https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki\n* Discord - https://discord.gg/zbWV6ueED7\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30479980\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30422517\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "We had some free time during the Chinese New Year vacation (we live in Taiwan). So I thought it would be fun to work with my daughter on a little web project.\nShe did all the drawings. I digitized them and added them to the page as inline SVGs. Then I wrote the code. Nothing fancy — it's just one HTML page with a few links. But I like the end result (yes, I'm 100% biased): https://kevin.tw\nFun technical facts: the page is entirely self-contained (except the favicon). It doesn't have any JavaScript at all. And it weighs 35Kb total (52Kb if you include the favicon).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30344989\nPoints: 788\n# Comments: 158",

Ideally, I can outsource most of this to a good web dev agency. We are in the MLOps space, and so some domain knowledge from the agency would be great (or the ablity to learn about the space and incorporate it into the design).

To consolidate our videos I tried to move the old account to our main \"erpnext\" account and it deleted all our old videos with 2M views and 11k subscribers!\nI am a pretty proficient user and I wasn't drunk or anything, this is just bad UX. Agreed I may not have read all the details, but there is no way YouTube should be doing this.\nMy feelings: Life is transient and my faith in platforms has been so shaken. There is no way to contact any kind of support for this other than \"Feedback\". To all engineers, product managers out there. Please be cognizant of the impact your UX decisions make on your users. And PLEASE MAKE IT HARD TO DELETE data.\nIf any kind YouTube engineers out here, please check if you can undelete our main channel.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30164146\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "LONDON, 1st March 2022 – AG Grid, the industry-leading provider of JavaScript datagrids, rolled out version 27 (AG Grid 27) this month, which introduces major improvements in developer productivity, functionality and accessibility.\nOne of the most noteworthy new features for AG Grid 27, is that its 100% React Rendering Engine is now the default engine for AG Grid React.

But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).\nAnd it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!\nYou can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.\nBy the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30373847\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "I suck at CSS. There, I said it.\nI've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.\nI understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.\nI've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.\nInstead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.\nOk, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?\nI must be missing something, right?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355757\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 20",

If my phone is in my peripheral vision I will pick it up at some point to check what's happening on it. If I'm working on a problem and I'm not sure exactly what to do I pick up my phone (to sooth my nerves).\nI don't like the habit, but I have it.\nI used to pick up my phone to check online dating sites a lot, but now I am less interested in them. So I find myself picking up my phone and not really being sure what to do with it when it is in my hands.\nThere are two directions I can go in (I think):\n1. Stop picking up my phone as much. This means my brain needs to get better at holding that boring period where there are no inputs. (I must be a dopamine addict)\n2. Find something more interesting to look at when I pick up my phone (by the morning I will already have checked Reddit and the news, so need something new).\nDoes anyone have any ideas of interesting apps to look at that could turn this habit into something productive?\nDoes anyone have any success getting more comfortable \"holding\" the boredom? (Maybe I should buy a Rubik's cube?!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30245071\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

This article will show you three techniques to help you breathe deeper while working out.\n\n\nDeep breathing has been shown to increase oxygen levels in the blood, improve cardiovascular health, and even boost mood. The problem is that most people are not aware of breathing correctly during exercise.\n\n\nYou should inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps prevent air from entering your lungs and causing them to collapse. You also open your chest and expand your ribcage when you breathe deeply. It is a great way to stretch the muscles of your upper back.\n\n\nWhen you breathe more deeply, you get more oxygen into your body. That means you are getting more energy d…",

Self-care is a vital element of stress management, even if it's difficult to prioritize when you have so many other things on your to-do list.\n\n\nHow Self-Care Can Help You\n\n\nWhen we're physically and emotionally exhausted, we're less equipped to handle the challenges that life throws at us. Or, to put it another way, when we are physically and emotionally at our best, we are more robust and capable of handling life's stress. A massage, a hot bath, or some other type of pampering rejuvenates you on the inside and out. Taking time to maintain self-care provides a number of advantages.\n\n\nPhysical Health Possibly Beneficial\n\n\nWh…",

Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.\nI'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.\nAnd I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.\nStay tuned.",

Nearly 400 people applied for the position.\nAs applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.\nI wanted to share one, in particular. This application is shared with the applicant's permission, although it's been slightly modified to remove personal information they weren't comfortable sharing publicly.\nBeyond it being an exceptionally good application — you'll know why when you see it — it was the one that got the person the job.

Betting your drive to get up in the morning on a single path will leave you completely stuck if that one road is blocked.\nDon't bet all your happiness and purpose on a single square. \nIt's fine to lean on one pillar or another at different times in your life, but you'd do well to make sure there's a few others holding up the roof if the first one crumbles. Yes, rock it out at work, but reserve some evenings and weekends for a hobby too. Sure, enjoy that tight-knit crew, but realize that life eventually changes for them some day as well.\nDiversification is resilience in action. It's having something in reserve. It's knowing that everyone, everywhere, doing anything, will eventually suffer setbacks, frustration, and despair. And planning for that by packing a bag with more than just hammers.\nIt doesn't have to be 33/33/33, but you aren't prepared for the likely life if it's 90/5/5.

          "description": "To say I've been skeptical about Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto universe would be an understatement of epic proportions. Since the early 2010s, some of my most ferocious Twitter battles have been against the HODL army with the laser eyes.\nThere's just so much to oppose: Bitcoin's grotesque energy consumption, the ridiculous transaction fees and low throughput, the incessant pump'n'dump schemes in shitcoins, the wild price swings in the main coins, the obvious fraud that is Tether, the lack of real decentralization in most of the current web3 infrastructure, and on, and on, and on.\nBeyond all these very real problems and challenges, my bigger beef was actually fueled by a lack of imagination.

          "description": "What's the goodwill of developers worth to a platform operator? It's a hard question, because it can't be answered by the traditional economic models used by bean counters to populate the balance sheet. And it's far more ephemeral than the goodwill of consumers. The relationship is more intertwined. We're not just engaging in transactions, we're lifting each other up. Good developers breed strong platforms, and strong platforms attract good developers. When it works, it's symbiotic.\nThere's nothing symbiotic about Apple's current relationship with its developers. \nEvery time Apple mobilizes its law machine to squash a developer in court, foil democratic accountability in the legislatures, or give regulators the middle finger, Apple wounds the relationship with developers.

You know, the ancient practice of listening, presenting arguments, accepting counterarguments, and progressing towards a deeper shared understanding. Even when the topics are hot. Even when the counterpart is a stranger. And it's giving me vintage internet vibes!\nTake this Canadian trucker protest, for example. I've heard from a lot of Canadians on the topic. Some support the protests, others don't. It's clearly a topic where a Canadian might feel like a Dane shouldn't have standing to participate in the discussion (and plenty do!). Yet literally all the many debates I've had over the past week since writing about this topic have managed to be civil and respectful despite also occasionally being tense.

After a decade's worth of front-end progress kept demanding ever more complicated setups, we're finally moving in the opposite direction. With simpler tools that are still able to hit those high-fidelity user interface notes, but at a sliver of the cost in complexity. The long expansion of enabling concepts is now at last being compressed for human comprehension. Hallelujah!\nAnd like with expanding complexity, where one complication often leads to another, compressing complexity also cascades.\nPropshaft, a new asset pipeline library for Rails, is the result of such a cascading compression of complexity.

          "description": "I'd been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since retiring from the back-and-forth, it's clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.\nThis is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I'd be surprised if you aren't aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it's a shock to the system.\nThat shock isn't the problem, though. It's the solution. It's your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, producing everything from ulcers to heart disease.\nI think most people already know this, but I don't think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn't be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries. That's a longitudinal study I'd love to see.

          "description": "Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It's quite literally a creative force.\nWhen you're focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.\nThis is the wisdom of the Mark Twain's etiquette \"never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company\". Specifically the point about \"polite company\". It's the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.\nAll this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People's religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration. \nToday social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people's stances on the thorniest issues. It's often hard not to know someone's leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.\nBut it's worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That's the choice of the creative force.",

If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:\nThere is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.\nI hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.\nRead the article →",

          "description": "Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.\n\nRecently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).\nOften we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)\nOne thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.\nTools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.\nVisit the site →",

The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.\nIn their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).\nAnd then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.\nSo you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo?

          "description": "We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:\nThat time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.\nThat time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.\nThat time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.\nThat time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.\nThat time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.\nThat time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.\nThat time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.\nThat time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.\nThat time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.\nSweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.\nI really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.",

Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on. HEB, the grocery store, was a better government. Although spared a catastrophe, Texas — in the form of Gov.

I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it.…",

It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.\nWith the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.\n\nふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n\nThe city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world",

          "description": "“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”\nManos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.\nI first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.\n\n\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n\n\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'",

Some solution where I can create a custom search engine that will only search whitelisted blogs/twitter users/Youtubers etc.?\nIdeally a solution would let me enter my favorite blogs and let me connect my social media accounts and then automatically search only content of users I follow. I haven't found anything like this.\nMaybe someone here wants to build this if this does not already exist :) This would solve the problem of Google results getting less valuable due to SEO. Custom whitelisted search could be used to only search within a network of trust.

          "description": "Is there a name for the feeling like you're about to trip and fall that you get, when a UI is inconsistent?\nFor example, if a New Document Wizard uses Alt+N (\"Next\") to proceed through several screens of input, before switching to Alt+D (\"Done\") at the last screen.  At that point, you need to get out of the habit of using \"Next\" to proceed and start using your new document, and must use \"Done\" instead.\nEvery time I hit one of those weird little UI inconsistencies, it makes me feel like I'm about to trip and fall like in music, when a drummer misses the beat.\nEdit: I'm not talking about intentional dark-patterns, I'm talking about things caused by oversights or deadlines.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30804824\nPoints: 2\n# Comments: 3",

          "description": "The MDN Web docs [0] are useful to understand what are custom elements, the shadow DOM, or templates and slots. But as someone starting with web components and front-end stuff in general, I was wondering about the recommended approaches/design patterns when building more complex apps ?\nFor instance, how should components communicate with each other? By using a parent element systematically, firing up events from child nodes, then calling children methods from the parent node? Is this the equivalent of the \"props down, events up\" pattern in React for instance [1]?\nRegarding the life-cycle, is there any reason to use the `constructor()` instead of the `connectedCallback()` for init code?\nAnother one that seems to have sparked some debate [2]: how to work with custom elements that need to interact with their children? Should I use `setTimeout()` to wait for the DOM to be parsed [3], should I use mutation observers, or should I fire up an event from the children to notify its parent when it is ready to be used?\nThese are just a couple questions that came up when reading about this, but I am curious about general best practices when building front-end apps using web components.\n[0] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\n[1] https://jasonformat.com/props-down-events-up/\n[2] https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/issues/809\n[3] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58354531/custom-elements-connectedcallback-wait-for-parent-node-to-be-available-bef\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30754394\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.\n2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.\nThose who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.\nI've been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.\nI hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30804893\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Hi HN,\na while ago I discovered a problem with problem with personal productivity tools: Every time you find a tool that works well in one regard (say, habit tracking), you neglect your previously working systems (say, your to do list system).\nSo I set about to build a system which unifies all the different aspects of personal productivity. Everything is represented in cards (like flash cards) which are defined in Markdown. The following types of cards exist:\n* Learning: Classic front/back prompts to memorize things. Think \"What is the capital of Argentina?\" on the front and \"Buenos Aires\" on the back.

With that update, the <dialog> element is now supported in every evergreen browser. It’s a great step forward for frameworks and libraries looking to make better use of native behaviors, but it’s also not without its limits.\nDefault styles\nChrome, Safari, and Firefox all render dialogs similarly—black border, black text, white background. They’re all positioned absolutely without a predefined z-index. There’s also no default ::backdrop styling. Check out the CodePen demo.\n\n\n\nOnly minor differences in the border-width it seems.\nWhen there’s too much content, all dialogs will have an inner scroll.

Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.\nHere’s the final demo via CodePen.\nSee the Pen \n  Scrolling nav by Mark Otto (@emdeoh)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\n\nHere’s a look at what’s under the hood.

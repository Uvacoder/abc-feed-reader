          "description": "You’ve probably heard the term “web3” bandied around quite a bit over the past year or so — along with related terminology like “blockchain”, “crypto” and “NFTs”. If you’re a web developer you’d be forgiven for thinking that this technology is something you need to jump on right away, or risk being left behind. This post by Hidde de Vries explains why we should be cautious about the misleading term “web3”, and not mistake it for some kind of official release. As he writes:\nThere is no institution that regularly releases new versions of the web, and recently happily announced this one.\nIt certainly doesn’t hurt to be aware of these new technologies. They are the subject of much debate at the moment, and may or may not prove useful in the long run. But, Hidde argues, there is plenty of the web that is getting on just fine without it, and lots of exciting innovation happening on the web platform itself that have nothing to do with the blockchain.\nI hope that “web3” and its associated terminologies don’t become buzzwords that recruiters look for in a CV. For most web development roles, specialist knowledge of this area is completely unnecessary.\nRead the article →",

The email went to spam and you didn’t see it for 3 days, but hey, we’re making progress.\nIn their email, they say in big red letters that you must use Internet Explorer to download it (or an ancient version of Firefox).\nAnd then you try that, and it fails. Because when you ordered the cert, you didn’t use the on-page tool that required using an ancient web browser. You used OpenSSL to create your certificate signing request (CSR) and private key.\nSo you call them, and they tell you to call your reseller. Wait – SectigoStore is not actually owned by Sectigo?

Here is a retelling of the vibes.\nClosing my rings\nThis month I decided I would undergo a challenge to close my rings on my Apple Watch every single day for the whole month and I succeeded!1\nIt’s safe to say this hasn’t ever happened. My regiment was a mixture of walks, special Apple Fitness+ celebrity-guided walks (Dolly and Malala), and a heap of Apple Fitness+ workouts. As far as workout programs go, I appreciate the body diversity in Apple Fitness+ — it’s not a bunch of yoga thin hard bodies yelling at me to touch my toes to my ears, it’s real people.\nDid it make a difference in my weight?

The ever-graceful Buffy Sainte Marie1 comes in to share a song with him about the different kinds of love and attention you can give people based on their needs, with the refrain “different people, different ways.” Big Bird seems placated.\n“Different people, different ways” has been a useful parenting tool.

          "description": "We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:\nThat time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.\nThat time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.\nThat time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.\nThat time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.\nThat time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.\nThat time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.\nThat time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.\nThat time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.\nThat time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.\nSweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.\nI really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.",

          "description": "February was a month that felt like ten months; cold, hot, beautiful, windy, busy, stressful, and globally catastrophic. But beyond that last part, it’s been a month of growth, reorganizing, and learning about stress.\nSurvived the freeze\nTexas had another big winter storm this month. Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on.

If you read Ethan Marcotte’s 2010 A List Apart article on responsive web design on the day of publication you might have done so with Chrome 4. By the time Media Queries became a W3C Recommendation in 2012, Chrome 19 was available.\nChrome was at version 43 when Alex Russell and Frances Berriman introduced Progressive Web Apps in 2015, with Microsoft announcing Edge as the new browser to replace Internet Explorer in the same year.\nIn March 2017, version 57 brought us CSS Grid, the layout method was shipped in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari within days of each other. This shared release of a major feature happened again more recently, with Cascade Layers landing in Chrome 99, along with Firefox 97, and Safari 15.4.\nTell us which moments you loved the most.

According to the UNHCR, the number of civilians fleeing Ukraine has now reached 2 million, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\nAt Dribbble, we believe creativity thrives when human beings are free to design their lives without fear of violence. That’s why we’re partnering with the International Rescue Committee to provide relief to Ukrainians seeking refuge. Their teams are on the ground in Poland providing critical aid to families fleeing the conflict and trying to gain control over their future. Dribbble will donate $50,000 USD to this cause.\nOver the coming days, we will also showcase Ukrainian creators across our platforms. We encourage you to support their extraordinary design work on Dribbble and ready-to-use assets on Creative Market’s new Finds Page.\nWe’re here to empower creatives to make a living doing what they love, in peace.\nZack Onisko",

          "description": "Hey, HN! When building user interfaces for smaller and mobile apps you've got quite a few tools to choose from. Figma and the like work great for them. But for the complex projects we do at our UX agency, those tools are a pain to use. Designing a control interface for an industrial machine in Figma doesn't make any fun. You often need to somehow hack the interactions you need into it.\nTo make prototyping complex interfaces easier, we built Antetype.\nWith layouts that really adapt to changing content and (hopefully) easy-to-understand interaction options. For us, it really helps creating complex and working UIs – to test and validate ideas.\nAntetype is also build on web concepts: \nThat means you can use any HTML/CSS tricks you know and also any JS framework you require. We often use that to embed interactive 3D models or working charts (instead of static images).\nVideo of Antetype's features + prototypes built with it: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUBpJlLJrdY\nWebsite with examples + demo videos:\nhttps://www.antetype.com\nRegister to download it (macOS only):\nhttps://cloud.antetype.com/register/\n(You can use it entirely free. No water marks or restrictions. Our paid plan just takes care of hosting if you don't want to do it yourself.)\nI would love to hear your thoughts – we released it to the public just a few weeks ago.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30852905\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "With every major release of Windows, MS seems to just add a new UI design language to the previous ones, making Windows ever more cluttered and inconsistent.\nWith Win11, there was room for MS to finally get rid of legacy designs that have plagued Windows for over 2 decades!! But unfortunately, Win11 is just a new skin on top of a pile of inconsistent design languages from before. Sure, there are improvements to the desktop and the settings app, but anything more serious and you're faced with windows dating back to Windows 95/98.\nThis doesn't seem like a problem that MS would be unaware of. But as much as I'd like to justify their actions by assuming that they still follow their backward compatibility philosophy, they have long crossed the line. Win11 design looks like a slap in the face of the customer. At the same time, MS could easily afford to hire better designers (which I think is not the main problem) or invest in consistent design across their Windows products, and yet they're not doing that.\nI'm happy that many are now switching to Linux just because the alternative (Win11) sucks so much. But frankly, I wish MS would fix this decades-old mess asap.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30817570\nPoints: 3\n# Comments: 5",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30812988\nPoints: 112\n# Comments: 11",

          "description": "I need to get up from my chair and take a walk at regular intervals for medical reasons, But I often forget to do that when I'm immersed with work, So I wanted a solution which reminds me to take a walk at regular intervals automatically.\nHence I created Butt Mover to solve that problem, It has two parts;\n1. Butt Trigger: An ESP8266 based button switch which goes under a butt cushion on the chair and is connected to the computer.\n2. Butt Mover: The game which starts the task timer (25 minute interval) when we sit on the chair and reminds to take a walk when the timer ends(with audio). When we get up from the chair the break timer (5minutes for 5 tasks and a long break for 30 minutes) starts and reminds to get back to the seat when the timer ends.\nThose who cannot build the Butt Trigger, Can start the timers manually but that removes the major advantage of not having to focus explicitly on Butt Mover.\nI've been using a crude version of this setup for past two years with good improvement in my productivity and health; So I finally created a version which is more accessible to others upon suggestion from many including some from HN.\nI hope you can try Butt Mover, Especially with the Butt Trigger and if you liked what it does then you can also build and sell Butt Trigger for others who are interested.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30804893\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

It’s a great step forward for frameworks and libraries looking to make better use of native behaviors, but it’s also not without its limits.\nDefault styles\nChrome, Safari, and Firefox all render dialogs similarly—black border, black text, white background. They’re all positioned absolutely without a predefined z-index. There’s also no default ::backdrop styling.

Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.\nHere’s the final demo via CodePen.\nSee the Pen \n  Scrolling nav by Mark Otto (@emdeoh)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\n\nHere’s a look at what’s under the hood.

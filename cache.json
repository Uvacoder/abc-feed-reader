Last I left it, I was gathering use cases and they seem to suggest that the most common use case for the Web Share API is sharing the URL of the current page.\nIf you want to catch up on the history of this proposal, here’s what I’ve previously written:\nA declarative Web Share API\nA polyfill for button type=”share”\nThe reason for a share button type\nRemember, my proposal isn’t to replace the JavaScript API, it’s to complement it with a declarative option. The declarative option doesn’t need to be as fully featured as the JavaScript API, but it should be able to cover the majority use case. I think this should hold true of most APIs.\nA good example is the Constraint Validation API. For the most common …",

I don’t want to get notified if a new email arrives (I avoid email on my phone completely) and I certainly don’t want some social media app telling me somebody liked or faved something.\nBut the number one feature I’d like to see in Safari on iOS is web notifications.\nIt’s not for me personally, see. It’s because it’s the number one reason why people are choosing not to go all in progressive web apps.\nSafari on iOS is the last holdout. But that equates to enough marketshare that many companies feel they can’t treat notifications as a progressive enhancement.

          "description": "Fershad Irani’s tool lets you check if your third-party scripts use green hosting.\n\nRecently I’ve been thinking quite a bit about third-party scripts and how much bloat they so often add to the average webpage — and, consequently, their impact on climate change via the additional carbon emissions generated, often for something the end user doesn’t really want or need. Third-party scripts can include ads, trackers, analytics, social media embeds, and probably some other stuff too. An analysis by Marmelab found that up to 70% of the carbon footprint of media websites could be attributed to ads and stats (source).\nOften we as developers aren’t in a position to remove these things entirely, and the conversation around web monetisation is a complex one. But we should at least load them as responsibly as possible. (I wrote about some strategies for optimising social media embeds for Smashing Magazine.)\nOne thing we might not consider, however, is whether the third parties themselves use green web hosting — that is, hosting that is powered by renewable energy. Fershad Irani has developed a useful tool that analyses the third-party scripts on your website: Are My Third Parties Green? checks whether they use a green web host (to the best of knowledge, via The Green Web Foundation’s dataset), as well as how much of your site’s overall size comes from third-party scripts, how effectively they’re cached, and their estimated carbon emissions.\nTools like this are great for shining a light on the environmental impact of our websites. Although measuring the carbon emissions of a website is far from an exact science, projects like this help raise awareness, and enable us to begin conversations and increasingly make informed choices.\nVisit the site →",

In the post he shares his opinions on blogging as a way to order your thoughts and ideas, somewhere between a sketchbook full of notes and a fully-formed essay. He writes:\nThe very act of recording your actions and impressions is itself powerfully mnemonic, fixing the moment more durably in your memory so that it’s easier to recall in future, even if you never consult your notes.\nThat’s certainly the way it works for me. I find the best way to learn about a technical concept is by writing about it. Often I’ll refer back to a blog post I’ve written in the past, to refresh my memory.

          "description": "Earlier this month I has the pleasure of speaking at a special green-themed edition of Toronto Web Performance Meetup (online). There were three of us speaking in all, each with a different take on how we as web developers can reduce our environmental impact.\nWeb Performance And The Planet\nFershad Irani spoke about how web performance relates to our site’s carbon emissions, and the concrete actions we can take to build our sites greener. His article analysing the COP26 website helped inspire my own article for CSS Tricks on website carbon budgets.\nWatch Fershad’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nBuilding a Greener Web\nMy own talk was about the wider context around reducing our website’s environmental impact, how we can convince stakeholders to make it a priority, and why individual action matters. I also talked about some of the things we can do beyond making our websites greener, as part of the wider community.\nWatch the talk →\nSee the slides →\nThe Carbon Footprint of Images\nJon A. Særetås talked about images on the web, and how we can reduce their environmental impact. His talk included some really interesting data, and some surprising details we don’t often consider — like the fact that many of our file live on in the cloud indefinitely, meaning they continue to consume resources.\nWatch Jon’s talk →\nSee the slides →\nYou might notice that this post avoids including YouTube embeds. I recently wrote about the environmental and performance impact of third-party embeds for Smashing Magazine. Linking to the videos instead of embedding them vastly reduced the page weight — and saves you, the user, from downloading unnecessary resources if you choose not to watch the videos!",

It’s known for being super fast.\nElectron is a framework for building cross-platform desktop apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s known for being kinda slow and bloaty.

          "description": "We said goodbye last month to our 2009 Rockwood Freedom popup camper “Big Freeda”. Lots of fond memories in this rustic little camper, but ultimately she cost us about $500 every time we wanted to take it out. Goodbyes are hard, but let us remember the moments we shared:\nThat time we had a blow out on the way home from Dinosaur Valley.\nThat time we were packing up at Pedernales in the rain and the dog escaped off leash but came back covered in coyote shit.\nThat time we went to Inks Lake and you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to McKinney falls and you wouldn’t pop up, so we used the backup bolt and sheared it off.\nThat time we were coming back from Garner and had two blow outs.\nThat time we brought it back from the shop and were trying to show our neighbor the inside of the popup but it only popped up half-way.\nThat time we were leaving McKinney and the trailer fell off the hitch.\nThat time we missed a trip to Inks Lake because you wouldn’t pop up.\nThat time we went to Mustang Island and got eaten alive by mosquitos.\nThat time we went to Pedernales and the wheel well fell out.\nThat time we hauled you up to Georgetown and you wouldn’t pop up.\nSweet memories of camper ownership, each of them. For real, I cherish every one. Every problem was an “Oh shit” moment, a challenge, that our family had to respond to and figure out. Put outside of our comfort zone. In some ways that’s what camping is: endless fighting against the elements or your equipment. While not “fun”, I wouldn’t trade the experiences.\nI really wanted to yeet Big Freeda into the ocean, or feed it to a Truckasaurus Rex… but alas, a less dignified sale took place. That’s okay. We’re not done camping as a family, some of our best memories are from camping, but we’re not going to jump right away into a new camper. We want to take some time and figure out the best fit for us going forward.",

Thankfully the grid didn’t shut down but after talking to a lot of Austinites, I think we all have a bit of trauma from the freeze last year. A state government unable to keep the lights and heat on.

          "description": "Here’s something I’ve been mulling around. Often in programming you hit a situation where you have to choose two paths:\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe 30 day fix (+30 days of repercussions)\nI know, I know, that’s a gross generalization but it’s related to the tension between speed and sustainability in software development. I’ll explain a bit further…\nThe 15 minute fix\nThe fifteen minute fix is the most direct way to solve the problem. A hard-coded value, installing a third-party library, adding another prop, or introducing a manual process to get the job done. You don’t have time to find the right abstraction, to write it yourself, think through all the edge cases, or automate the process. But deep in the back of your mind, you know that you made a compromise…\nSometimes the compromise is worth it.…",

          "description": "I know a bit about Japanese folk music (民謡), but Pete Seeger opened my eyes to and old song called  “Genbaku O Yurusumaji (Forgive us the atom bomb)”, an anti-nuclear Japanese dirge.\nBorn in the US in the cold war, it never seemed necessary to establish an anti-nuclear stance. It just was. A threat deterrent as much as a threat. Or so we told ourselves. Moving to Japan and witnessing Hiroshima changed that for me. The perspective the Japanese have changes your perspective.\nWith the current threat of atomic warfare, this song has been on my mind.\n\nふるさとの街やかれ\n身よりの骨うめし焼土に\n今は白い花咲く\nああ許すまじ原爆を    \n三度許すまじ原爆を    \nわれらの街に\n\nふるさとの海荒れて\n黒き雨喜びの日はなく\n今は舟に人もなし\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの海に\n\nふるさとの空重く\n黒き雲今日も大地おおい\n今は空に陽もささず\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\nわれらの空に\n\nはらからのたえまなき\n労働にきずきあぐ富と幸\n今はすべてついえ去らん\nああ許すまじ原爆を\n三度許すまじ原爆を\n世界の上に\n\nThe city of my hometown\nWe buried the charred bones of our relatives\nWhite flowers are blooming now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our city\n\nThe sea of my hometown is rough\nThere is no day of joy in black rain\nThere are no people in the boats now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sea\n\nThe sky of my hometown\nBlack clouds, the earth is covered today\nNow the sun isn't in the sky\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nIn our sky\n\nNo praise from the belly\nWealth and happiness is labor\nI can't leave everything now\nOh forgive the nuclear bomb\nForgive the nuclear bomb three times\nOn top of the world",

          "description": "“The Accordion” (Τ’ ακορντεόν) is an old, popular Greek song written by Manos Loïzos (Μάνος Λοΐζος) in 1967 while Greece was under far-right military junta control. It’s an unassuming anti-fascist song with it’s slow, folksy tone and fluttering accompaniment, but it’s final words offer a somber battle cry: “Fascism will not prevail!”\nManos spent his latter years in the Soviet Union where he died in Moscow in 1982. I’m not sure if he ever escaped fascism (despotism?), but perhaps the communism of the Soviet Union suited him better than the military junta in Greece.\nI first heard this song on a news story about Orestes Fintiklis. Fintiklis was removing Trump’s name from his international hotel in Panama when a scuffle happened between security staff and the new management. Once the fight broken up, employees terminated, and Trump’s name removed from the hotel, Fintiklis sat down at the piano and played this song.\n\n\nΣτη γειτονιά μου την παλιά είχα ένα φίλο\nπου ήξερε και έπαιζε τ' ακορντεόν\nόταν τραγούδαγε φτυστός ήταν ο ήλιος\nφωτιές στα χέρια του άναβε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΜα ένα βράδυ σκοτεινό σαν όλα τ' άλλα\nκράταγε τσίλιες παίζοντας ακορντεόν\nφασιστικά καμιόνια στάθηκαν στη μάντρα\nκαι μια ριπή σταμάτησε τ' ακορντεόν\n\nΤ' αρχινισμένο σύνθημα πάντα μου μένει\nόποτε ακούω από τότε ακορντεόν\nκι έχει σαν στάμπα τη ζωή μου σημαδέψει\nδε θα περάσει ο φασισμός\n\n\nIn my old neighborhood I had a friend\nwho knew and played the accordion\nwhen he sang, he was like the sun\nfires in his hands ignited by the accordion\n\nBut at one dark night, like every other night\nhe kept a look-out playing the accordion\nfascist trucks stood in the paddock\nand a gun shot stopped the accordion\n\nThe started slogan comes back to me\nwhenever I hear an accordion\nand it has marked my life like a stamp\n'Fascism will not prevail!'",

The idea was simple: someone visits catsarethebest.com, where they’re loading jquery.1.1.8.js from the jQuery CDN. Then, that same person visits dogsarebetter.",

          "description": "Just released v0.3.2 of Hibiki HTML (lots of new changes and features)!\nThe biggest, from the feedback I got on HN, is that Hibiki HTML is now\nlicensed under the standard MPL v2 (Mozilla Public License v2, OSI\napproved), and is able to be integrated into any project (free,\ncommercial, or (A)GPL) without any fear over a non-standard license.\nI've also released a new Bulma UI control library for Hibiki -\nhttps://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html .  It features buttons,\ntabs, menus, modals, great looking form inputs and controls, and a\nsimple data-table control with built in sorting and pagination!  There\nare also Hibiki HTML library wrappers for rendering markdown and code\nhighlighting.\nHibiki HTML is a great middle ground between vanilla HTML and full-on\nJS frameworks like React or Vue.  You can add dynamic functionality,\nreuseable components, and backend REST calls in a single HTML file.\nNo tools to install, no JavaScript stack to configure,\nno build process, and no need to be a JavaScript expert.\nIt works works great for embedding into backend\nservers (or scripts), tools to interact with REST APIs, or\nadding dynamic functionality to static sites.\nI'd love to to hear and answer any feedback, questions, or comments.\nIf you have a project you'd like to use Hibiki HTML on, I'm also happy\nto lend a hand or build out additional functionality or components you\nmight need.\n* Interactive Tutorial - https://playground.hibikihtml.com/tutorial/\n* Bulma UI Controls - https://libs.hibikihtml.com/test-bulma.html\n* Github - https://github.com/dashborg/hibiki\n* Discord - https://discord.gg/zbWV6ueED7\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30479980\nPoints: 1\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "eBPF is an amazing technology that allows safely running user-supplied functions at pretty much arbitrary probe points in a kernel/user space context. Much has been written about how amazing this feature is for kernel observability. But as someone who writes user space code, what I find even more amazing is the support for tracing arbitrary user space programs, with no code changes and low overhead.\nHowever, doing in-depth analysis can get complicated and time-consuming. My goal with wachy was to make this debugging significantly easier/faster to use, by displaying traces in a TUI next to the source code and allowing for interactive drilldown analysis. If you get a chance, check out the start of the demo video since (AFAIK) it's quite unique and gives a much clearer idea than I can provide with just text.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30422517\nPoints: 10\n# Comments: 0",

          "description": "Pre-covid, I was traveling full time to teach ReactJS to corporate clients. My students (mostly developers at banks and insurance companies) would ask me 'What's a good React book?' and I would struggle to recommend something, knowing that all the books sucked or were really out of date. When all my face-to-face training work dried up and I really didn't want to do online training, I magically got a contract to write a book.\nI started by reading all of the best-selling books on React, and, yeah, they were all really out of date, incomplete, or just wrong.\nAs I started writing what I hoped would be a really good React book, I also wanted the website to be something useful and a notch above a typical book website. So, I tried to have working examples of the code listings on the site and to organize them in a way that would make them useful for when I started teaching again, or for anyone who doesn't want to buy a book and just wants to see how things are done.\nThe book just came out today! The website isn't perfect or done, but here it is: https://reactjsfoundations.com .\nHow'd I do?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30620011\nPoints: 4\n# Comments: 4",

          "description": "LONDON, 1st March 2022 – AG Grid, the industry-leading provider of JavaScript datagrids, rolled out version 27 (AG Grid 27) this month, which introduces major improvements in developer productivity, functionality and accessibility.\nOne of the most noteworthy new features for AG Grid 27, is that its 100% React Rendering Engine is now the default engine for AG Grid React.

But further than that it's actually a really good way to develop applications, it's a mix of old meets new where the paradigm encourages you to take advantage of web standards for data fetching (forms, links, a tags).\nAnd it turns out that it's actually an optimal way to develop simple or even complex web applications which can deploy in a number of runtime environments (including edge workers). So you can get an insanely fast website for users. Note that this project is not necessarily an optimal website implementation (since it copies Hacker News) but rather it's intended to be useful as a starting point or reference for your own projects!\nYou can read about some of the benefits of it on the project page linked.\nBy the way I'm currently available to work (if you email me at clinton.dannolfo @gmail!)\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30373847\nPoints: 64\n# Comments: 44",

          "description": "I suck at CSS. There, I said it.\nI've always loved frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, etc... that let's me build frontends the same way I would play Legos as a kid.\nI understand CSS, what the properties do, individually. But I lack the creativity and design skills required to come up with half of what is provided by those frameworks. I could do it if I had infinite time and patience, but I don't.\nI've heard a lot of good about TailwindCSS for a couple of years now. So I gave it a try. From what I've gather after a few days, I don't understand it.\nInstead of writing CSS, I add classes to my HTML. Ok, but I don't want to rewrite everything all the time, it would be like using the inline style attribute.\nOk, then I install PostCSS, and start writing classes with @apply. Wait, hang on, isn't that just writing plain old CSS with a new syntax and new names to learn?\nI must be missing something, right?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30355757\nPoints: 25\n# Comments: 20",

          "description": "Continuing with my JavaScript fun, I wanted to do an updated pass on the horizontal navs I’ve previously built for both GitHub Mobile (prior to the current responsive version and native apps) and this Bootstrap dashboard example.\nThe goal? Build a responsive horizontal navigation with an overflow scroll that automatically scrolls the active nav link into view. The responsive part is that the navigation links scroll horizontally—easy enough, and scales decently well across all viewports. The scrolling part and active link setting is done in JS and, thanks to work on the upcoming redesign of Bootstrap’s docs, relatively straightforward.\nHere’s the final demo via CodePen.\nSee the Pen \n  Scrolling nav by Mark Otto (@emdeoh)\n  on CodePen.\n\n\n\nHere’s a look at what’s under the hood.

Courses have been helpful, but it seems that no matter the course, I do my best learning by making things myself. So I’ve been tinkering around and trying to build some new projects.\nMy latest experiment was to build something that allows me to toggle a class on an element with a particular id.\n\n<button type=\"button\" data-toggle-target=\"#example\" data-toggle-class=\"blue\">\n  Toggle\n</button>\n\n<div id=\"example\">\n  This element will have the <code>.blue</code> class toggled on it.\n</div>\n\n\nThe gist is that I want to use a <button> to toggle any class I want on another element of my choosing, all using data attributes so that it’s infinitely flexible and functional in any context.\nNothing b…",

The problem is that most people are not aware of breathing correctly during exercise.\n\n\nYou should inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps prevent air from entering your lungs and causing them to collapse. You also open your chest and expand your ribcage when you breathe deeply.

If the site doesn’t render in 10 seconds, we show a fallback image by default.

I'm now on a team of three folks working toward those goals, and if this sounds like a pretty sweet deal to you, we are hiring.\nAnd personally speaking, I'm just so grateful to have this opportunity. Grateful to the folks that have trusted Eleventy with their web projects, grateful to folks that have participated in our community, whether it be answering questions, writing blog posts, code, docs, or being friendly on Discord, Twitter, or at meetups.\nI'm grateful to everyone building for the open web—accessible to all—independent of walled gardens and app stores, where a wallet isn't a prerequisite.\nAnd I don't know if you all can tell, but I am so excited. If Eleventy was walking before now we're going to find out what it really feels like to run.\nStay tuned.",

Outcomes unknown.\nSo he's staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it.\nHe asked me if I've ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it.\nI absolutely have, and I've always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on.\nI told him the way I've approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as \"overall, this job cost more than I expected\", rather than \"This guy fucked me, I'm out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it\".\nYes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now.\nLoss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.",

Nearly 400 people applied for the position.\nAs applications tend to do, they ranged from the basic resume, to the standard cover letter and resume, to the custom cover letter and resume, and, finally, some more creative approaches to stand out.\nI wanted to share one, in particular.

The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes—the ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior.\n\nIt's the same underlying premise to Julia Galaef's book The Scout Mindset.

Sure, enjoy that tight-knit crew, but realize that life eventually changes for them some day as well.\nDiversification is resilience in action. It's having something in reserve. It's knowing that everyone, everywhere, doing anything, will eventually suffer setbacks, frustration, and despair. And planning for that by packing a bag with more than just hammers.\nIt doesn't have to be 33/33/33, but you aren't prepared for the likely life if it's 90/5/5. And it won't help you that one in a hundred can hit glory for a while betting it all on 100/0/0. You'll only ever see their highlight reel, and you'll never see the other ninety-nine who crashed and burned.\nDiversify your life.",

And while the more unfortunate expressions of this being due to \"blue eyes and blond hair\", it is fostering a strong sense of fraternity here in Europe. This just is different than a far-away war in Yemen or even Syria. Being upset about the basic human graduation of empathy – that makes us care more about that which is closer and familiar – is an intellectualization straight out of Haidt's WEIRD diagnosis.\nBeing able to read, in real time, about members of the Ukrainian parliament taking up arms, mixed together with pictures of walking the dog, is a deeply humanizing experience.

Having intense debates about big questions is a thrill. But this last one was different.\nPartly because we simply agreed more than we usually do, but also because the topics felt dangerous this time around.

You can't easily do that if your feature has been chopped into itty bitty pieces as independent pull requests under pressure never to let them run longer than a week. So at Basecamp, we let pull requests run as long as they need to encompass a complete feature or fix. That's everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow Shape Up).\nThis approach isn't entirely without trade-offs. The longer your pull request is running off the main branch, the greater the chance that you'll have merge conflicts.
